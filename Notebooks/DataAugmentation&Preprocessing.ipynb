Cars have been around since they became famous in the 1900s, when Henry Ford created and built the first ModelT. Cars have played a major role in our every day lives since then. But now, people are starting to question if limiting car usage would be a good thing. To me, limiting the use of cars might be a good thing to do.\\n\\nIn like matter of this, article, \"In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars,\" by Elizabeth Rosenthal states, how automobiles are the linchpin of suburbs, where middle class families from either Shanghai or Chicago tend to make their homes. Experts say how this is a huge impediment to current efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from tailpipe. Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe...and up to 50 percent in some carintensive areas in the United States. Cars are the main reason for the greenhouse gas emissions because of a lot of people driving them around all the time getting where they need to go. Article, \"Paris bans driving due to smog,\" by Robert Duffer says, how Paris, after days of nearrecord pollution, enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city. It also says, how on Monday, motorist with evennumbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at home or be fined a 22euro fine 31. The same order would be applied to oddnumbered plates the following day. Cars are the reason for polluting entire cities like Paris. This shows how bad cars can be because, of all the pollution that they can cause to an entire city.\\n\\nLikewise, in the article, \"Carfree day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota,\" by Andrew Selsky says, how programs that's set to spread to other countries, millions of Columbians hiked, biked, skated, or took the bus to work during a carfree day, leaving streets of this capital city eerily devoid of traffic jams. It was the third straight year cars have been banned with only buses and taxis permitted for the Day Without Cars in the capital city of 7 million. People like the idea of having carfree days because, it allows them to lesson the pollution that cars put out of their exhaust from people driving all the time. The article also tells how parks and sports centers have bustled throughout the city uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks rushhour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic and new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up. Having no cars has been good for the country of Columbia because, it has aloud them to repair things that have needed repairs for a long time, traffic jams have gone down, and restaurants and shopping districts have popped up, all due to the fact of having less cars around.\\n\\nIn conclusion, the use of less cars and having carfree days, have had a big impact on the environment of cities because, it is cutting down the air pollution that the cars have majorly polluted, it has aloud countries like Columbia to repair sidewalks, and cut down traffic jams. Limiting the use of cars would be a good thing for America. So we should limit the use of cars by maybe riding a bike, or maybe walking somewhere that isn't that far from you and doesn't need the use of a car to get you there. To me, limiting the use of cars might be a good thing to do.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    \n","1     Transportation is a large necessity in most countries worldwide. With no doubt, cars, buses, and other means of transportation make going from place to place easier and faster. However there's always a negative pollution. Although mobile transportation are a huge part of daily lives, we are endangering the Earth with harmful greenhouse gases, which could be suppressed.\\n\\nA small suburb community in Germany called Vauban, has started a \"carfree\" lifestyle. In this city, markets and stores are placed nearby homes, instead of being located by farend highways. Although Vauban is not completely carfree, 70% of Vauban families do not own cars Even a large 57% of families stated to have sold their cars to move to Vauban. Some families have even said to be less stressed depending on car transportation. Cars are responsible for about 12% of greenhouse gases, and can even be up to 50% in some carintensive areas in the United States.\\n\\nAnother insight to reduced car zones brings Paris' incident with smog. Paris' officials created a system that would in fact lower smog rates. On Monday, the motorists with evennumbered license plates numbers would be ordered to leave their cars at home, or they would suffer a fine. Same rule would occur on Tuesday, except motorists with oddnumbered license plates were targeted with fines. Congestion, or traffic, was reduced by 60% after five days of intense smog. Diesel fuel played a huge part in this pollution, having the fact that 67% of vehicles in France are of Diesel fuel. The impact of the clearing of smog, resided in banning the Tuesday rule of odd license plates.\\n\\nCould you imagine a day without seeing a single car being used? This phenomenon occurs once a year in Bogota, Colombia. With the exception of buses and taxis being used, cars are to be left unattended for an entire day. Having a carfree day just once a year can even reduce the pollution slightly. The day without cars is part of a campaign that originated in Bogota in the mid 1990s. This campaign has renewed and constructed numerous bicycle paths and sidewalks all over the city. Parks and sports centers have also sprung from this campaign. Devoting your time to a carfree lifestyle has it's hassles, but in hindsight, it has it's benefits.\\n\\nTo conclude, living a carfree lifestyle does not seem like a possibility in this day and age, however managing the use of cars and pollution is something every country should take time investing in. Think about how much of an impact it would be if everywhere worldwide would take part in airpollution reduction. Mobile transportation is lifestyle in a sense, and being dependent on cars or other means of transportation can impact the health of the Earth and even ourselves.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n","2     \"America's love affair with it's vehicles seems to be cooling\" says Elisabeth rosenthal. To understand rosenthal's perspective, it is easier to suggest that America's car usage is decreasing slowly. This isn't necessarily bad in the sense that it has certain positive effects. The advantages of limiting car usage includes an increase in security and health, along with a decrease in pollution and dependence.\\n\\nFirstly, when car usage is limited security and health is more likely to be guaranteed. The feeling of being secure is highly important to individuals everywhere. For example, many people in colombia used public transportation during a car free day \"leaving the streets of this capital city \", according to Andrew Selsky, \"eerily devoid of traffic jams\". The complications that stem from traffic jams end with a feeling of confidence. The plan to get from point A to B was more simple just a second ago. This complication in your personal plans leads you to become stressed as a feeling of doubt overcomes all thoughts. If car usage was limited, there would be a control on how much traffic accumulates thus minimizing chance of stress. As Heidrun Walter states \"when i had a car i was always tense. I'm much happier this way\". not only does car usage minimize conditions detrimental to health, it also enlarges your capacity for exercise. The main purpose of the car is to get someone from one place to another. when an important job takes over your personal life, it becomes difficult to do things most enjoyed in life. limits on car usage forces you to stay in shape. According to Andrew Selsky \"parks and sports centers also have bloomed throughout the city\". Less cars means healthier and natural situations. With parks and sport centers becoming more efficient, it becomes easier to find a more physically active population. Overall, less usage on cars minimizes stress and increases health.\\n\\nSecondly, limting car usage becomes beneficial to the environment. Now a days people have become annoyed with others who care so passionately about the environment. If you look behind their constant cries for action, there are solid facts. Yespollution is bad for the environment. Yes a bad envorment means unhealthy living. Yes cars are one of the main contributors to pollution in the environment. A pattern of less car usage, as Elisabeth Rosenthal states \"will have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the environment\". The less use of cars, the less pollution in the environment. One must observe limiting car usage as an opportunity to create a cleaner world and better future. The effects of pollution in the environment is completley dangerous and we, the car users, are to blame.\\n\\nAdditionally, it would lower the dependence on cars. Many people today find that their car is so useful. While it has many features and is a form of transportation, many do not figure what they would do if they did not have such a possesion. The development of people and their interaction with technology has left a wide gap between historic, natural ways and what is thought of as modern society. Being dependent is not always good for individuals. As david goldberg says \"all our development since world war II has been centered on the car, and that will have to change\". Many people could disagree and wonder why it is necessary to change our ways especially if we are so highly devloped. If being developed means being dependent on a harmful machine, then it could not be effective devlopment. According to Elisabeth Rosenthal \"cashstrapped americans could not afford new cars, and the unemployed were't going to work anyway\". Many people can't have the precious luxury of private transportation in the first place. Those who have had it have become distant to a more natural society. Peope have become so use to having cars that they have become oblivious to the significant effects. With limits on car usage , these effcts could be controlled.\\n\\nTo conclude, the advantages of limiting car usage is an increase in health, along with a decrease in pollution, and less dependence on cars. limiting car usage is a positive way to enfore an organized and clean environment, and ensure health and security of those who live in it. This is one reason America can be reffered to as a succesful country. It is not that America has decreased use of vehicles, but the fact that they have done what is best for majority.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               \n","3     How often do you ride in a car? Do you drive a one or any other motor vehicle to work? The store? To the mall? Have you ever thought about how many people in the world do that exact same thing travel to every destination using a fuel powered motorvehicle. Not many people realize the intensive damage that they're doing when they turn their key in the ignition. What if you didn't drive to work today? If you're like any regular car user, the thought \"What?! I could never survive without my car!\" may run through your mind. It is possible though, to live without your main mean of transport. Just look at cities like cuban, Paris, and Bogota each one has in some way restricted their people's usage of cars and they actually enjoy it! If you limit your car usage, it can intern result in many advantages and benefits in yourself and in your community.\\n\\nA not so recognized benefit to giving up your car usage would be the positive consequences it has on your health. In source 1, Heidrun Walter states that \"When he had a car, he was always tense. He's much happier without it.\" Think about it, imagine all the angry road rage you experience while driving. That surely does not have a positive effect on your mood or health. Driving takes a copious amount of focus and mental activity, such as, trying to navigate, dealing with bad drivers, etc., that after a short period of time, you're stressed out and tired. In cities like New York and Paris, the population is high. This leads to congestion in the streets and excessive amounts of pollution. Warm layers of air, according to Robert Duffer in \"Paris bans driving due to smog,\" traps the car emissions. How is that healthy? He also states that Paris had to enforce a temporary driving ban after the pollution levels reached an all time record. After a few days of less driving the pollution went way down. Since people aren't driving, they have to find other means of transport. This could include walking, biking, or skating to destinations. Those are all physical excercises! Your body is getting to work out and you'll mentally feel fresher more than you would sitting in a car.\\n\\nTaking a break from driving also can help with the overall look of your city. Pollution doesn't cause the flowers to grow. It certainly doesn't smell nice. It sets a filter over the town and gives off a \"dirty\" vibe. With less driving, there is less nasty pollution being emitted, therefore leading to a cleaner community. In Elisabeth Rosenthal's article, \"In German Suburb, Life goes on Without Cars,\" she gives the good point that since there is a restriction on car and motor vehicle transportation, there is going to be more walkers. If you have tons of people taking the sidewalks instead of the roads, you might need a few more pathways and closer stores that are in walking distance. Andrew Selsky states that \"Parks and sports centers have bloomed throughout the city uneven pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks... and new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up.\" As stated previously, pollution is not benefiting the environment. Organizations such as the Envronmental Protection Agency in the U.S., are promoting \"car reduced\" communities, says Rosenthal. These communities have far less pollution and are much cleaner. Cities are also promoting this idea and are having days devoted to \"nocar driving.\" In Bogota, Colombia, they hold an anual \"carfree\" day where only buses and taxis are permitted. Any other drivers would be fined. Although fining someone for using a posession they own might ruffle some feathers, it did have a successful turn out and significantly reduced the \"smog.\" In conclusion, although the idea of giving up our precious automobiles for walking to our destination might sound impossible, it's not. Reducing our driving can lead to many benefits and advantages in our daily lives. These include an increase in health, an improved look to our cities, and an improved environment all around us.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  \n","4     Cars are a wonderful thing. They are perhaps one of the worlds greatest advancements and technologies. Cars get us from point a to point i. That is exactly what we want isnt it? We as humans want to get from one place to anther as fast as possiile. Cars are a suitaile to do that. They get us across the city in a matter of minutes. Much faster than anyhting else we have. A train isnt going to get me across the city as fast as my car is and neither is a puilic ius, iut those other forms of transportation just might ie the way to go. Don't get me wrong, cars are an aisolutly amazing thing iut, mayie they just cause way to much stress, and mayie they hurt our environment in ways that we don't think they will. With a ius or a train you do not have to worry aiout washing your car or getting frustrated when stuck in a iad traffic jam on I4. Also there is not as much pollution in air hurting our environment. You might not think so, iut there are many advantages to limiting our car usage.\\n\\nOne advantage that not only humans would ienefit from, iut also plants and animals is that there would ie a lot less pollution in the air hurting out environment. Right now our cars give off gases that are extremely harmful towards our environment. These gases are called green house gases and come out of the exhaust pipes in our cars. Your car alone docent give off much gas iut collectively, our cars give off enormous amounts of gases. This is especially true in iig cities like France. In France, their pollution level was so high it was record ireaking. due to that france decided to enforce a partial ian on cars. This is descriied in the second article \" Paris ians driving due to smog\", iy Roiert Duffer, \" On Monday motorists with evennumiered license plates were orderd to leave their cars at home or suffer a 22euro fine 31. The same would apply to oddnumiered plates the following day.\" After France limited driving there congestion was down iy 60 percent. \" Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France\". So after five days of intense smog, 60 percent of it was clear after not using cars for only a little while. Even across the world in Bogota, columiia they are limiting driving and reducing smog levels. In the third article \"carfree day is spinning into a iig hit in Bogota\", iy Andrew Selsky, it descriies the annual carfree day they have to reduce smog. \" the goal is to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog\". So all over the world people are relizing that without cars, we are insuring the safety and well ieing of our environment.\\n\\nThe second advantage that would come with limiting car use is less stress. Everyone knows that driving a car causes emence amounts of stress. Getting caught in traffic is a major cause of stress in someones life. having to repeating wash your car just to get it dirt again causes stress. Having people in the iack of your car screaming and yelling all while music is ilasting, causes stress. So oiviously driving causes stress. If we were to limit our car usage we would not ie as stressed as we usually are. There would ie no traffic, no car washes and no one screaming in a small confineded space. In the first article \" In German Suiuri, life goes on without cars\", iy Elisaieth Rosenthal, a citizen named humdrum Walter, states \" When i had a car i was always tense. I'm much happier this way\". So with out the stress of a car humdrum Walter is a looser and happier person, less stress equals happier person. In the third article, \" Carfree dai is spinning into a iig hit in Bogota\", iy Andrew Selsky, it states \" It's a good opportunity to take away stress...\". If we have the opportunity to take away stress, why not take it. It is a huge advantage in our lives to limit driving if it takes away stress. No one wants stress, no one needs stress, and if we have an opportunity to take some of the stress away, take that opportunity.\\n\\nIn conclusion, there are many advantages to limiting car use, one ieing theat we get to help the environment and two ieing that it helps reduce stress. Our environment is already screwed up in so many ways, if we can help it to iecome the healthy environment it once was, then do it. Stress is proven to impare your personal health, no one wants to ie unhealthy and no one wants stress in their life.

Many people get confused about how it works and if they're satisfied with the whole process. Show we \"abolish\" the Elector College? Should we keep it? Honestly we should keep it. We the peope have more then enough control on who is chosen for the president of the United States Of America. We don't really vote for the president but our vote impacts the decision.\\n\\nMany citizens of the United States Of America think their vote doesn matter, it does. Why? Well, first the government is runned by the people. Its very rare to not get the president that has the most popular votes, the last time when the president wasn't chosen was in 1888. It's less likely for the president with the most votes to lose the election. For example, Obama received 61.7 percent of the elector votes compared to only 51.3 percent of the popular votes cast for him and rodney. Plus, almost all states award elector votes on a winnertakeitall basis.\\n\\nPerhaps, there was no system. Would it be simpler? Yes it would but we have to also be fair, there is 538 electors and a majority of 270 elector votes is required to elect the president. When you are voting for the president ypu want to win,you are actually voting for your canidate's elector. How does the system work? First it's the process that has the selection of the electors , the meeting of the electors where they vote for the president and vice president , and last but not least the counting of electoral votes by congress. Obviously it is kind of confusing because it would be much simpler if the winner would be the one with the most popular votes.\\n\\nDid you know that the Elector College avoids the problem of elections? They do due to how much pressure the candidte can go through. It can easily complicate the presidential process. For instance, Nixon in 1968 and Clinton in 1992 both had only a 43 percent plurality of the popular votes, while winning a majority in the Elector College 301 and 370 elector votes exactly. When avoiding the elections and campaigns , there a better chance of clear winner.\\n\\nSo there you have it,three main reason's why we should keep the Elector College. We have why the process is important and why we have it. How the process work's because it was confusing to many people , so it's defined and hopefully you'll like to stay and support the Elector College. Your vote does matter.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     \n","1374  Limiting car usage has many advantages. Such as putting a lot less pollution in the air and having your stress level go down letting you spend time with your family and friends. When we put pollution in the air it ruins our beautiful ecosystem. When driving a car you have to stress about how much gas you have or you stress about if you are going over the speed limit.\\n\\nThe first advantage to not having cars is we limit the amount of pollution in the air. Did you know that in Europe you cause up to twelve percent of its greenhouse gas, and in the US you cause up to fifty percent of that gas, that just goes in the air causing the air that we breath to become polluted. Some ways to prevent this is to carpool with someone or just to walk there and not drive, you get to help the environment and you get your daily workout as well. Some countries have taking the role of taxing anyone who wants to use a car. Like in France, who has a tax policy that makes people choose diesel instead of regular gasoline. France has over sixtyseven percent of cars that run on diesel fuel. Paris has banned the use of cars do to the huge amount of smog they are having.\\n\\nThe second advantage for limiting the usage of cars is lowering your stress level and being able to spend time with family and friends. To help with this some countries have programs that provide people with bikes and other forms of transportation in order for people to get to work. When people don't drive cars and walk with their kids to drop them off at school then go to work it keeps the traffic and all the stress that comes with it down to an all time low. When summer time comes around teens can organize what they do and who they hang out with based on where they are and how far they want to walk to get there.\\n\\nSo limiting the usage of cars has many significant advantages like less pollution and being able to spend time with family and friends while lowering your stress level. So before you get in your car and drive to wherever you are going just take a second and think, can I walk there instead.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    \n","1375  There's a new trend that has been developing for years now, and soon will be in full throttle affect. The mass amount of pollution being produced worldwide over the years has been at terrifying levels, up until the last five to ten years. Although not the first cause of the pollution, gases emitted from transportation is the second largest contributed to this \"green house gas\" issue going on, according to source 4. An idea to hinder this growing issue and potentially put the pollution levels at a decline is the effort to limit personal car usage. By doing this, we inhabitants of the world are able to help clear the air, reduce congestion on the streets, and live a simpler, more cost efficient lifestyle.\\n\\nPolution, as we know, is an ongoing trend that is proving lethal to our environment. Factories and power plants are the number one cause of pollution in the world. This is almost inevitable, since we have yet to develop a way to produce in mass amounts in a clean way. However, what we can have a part in is limiting the personal car usage to promote cleaner air. Public transportation, carpooling, and hybridelectric cars have been seen as the alternative to owning personal cars. Those options are also seen as the solution, considering their contribution to the act since \"the number of miles driven per person was nearly 9 percent below the peak of 2005\" source 4. Reducing the amout of miles driven links to the amout of dangerous gases emitted into the air, therefor \"having cleaner air.\" Rush hour traffic is obnoxious and is the least fun part of driving. Encouraging people to drive less and either walk, bike, or use public transportation will help end the long waits sitting bumpertobumper on the roads. In France, a study was done where fines were placed on people who drove by themselves or with only one passenger excluding hybrids and \"plug in\" cars. According to the source, \"congestion was down 60 percent.\" Just a week of not driving with personal gasoline or diesel cars proved to be extremely beneficial in clearing out the streets, making for easier courses to work. The concept is truly simple. We use less cars, there's less people on the street, and you can get to and fro much faster and without hassle. Reducing the number of cars on the street is also a goodway to inspire motor companies to be inventive. Losing business will ultimately result in extermination of the business, unless the corporation is able to come up with new products to satisfy the consumer. Mitsubishi is a automotive company that also makes air conditioners. According to source 4, Ford and Mercedes are \"rebranding\" themselves to comply with the new trend.\\n\\nAlmost everyone wants to live a clean, healthy and simple lifestyle and participation in limiting the number of cars driven daily is a very easy way to do so. Heidrun Walter, a media trainer and mother of two, said,\"When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way\" source 1. This refers to the successful suburban trial in Vauban, Germany to no longer own cars. Parking on the street, personal garages, and driveways in general are seen as taboo in the living district near France and Switzerland's border source 1. Very few people own cars, let alone drive them. Not only does lowering the usage of cars help the environment and make the journey to wherever you're going much less complicated, it also initiates the restoration of things considered not as important such as sidewalks, parks, and public transport systems. The more people using the utilities, the more cities will fund them and make the experience more enjoyable. In Bogata, the \"day without cars\" campaign has led to 118 miles of bycle paths being constructed source 3. The chain of events will lead to more and more people utilizing their bikes and feet to get around, instead of cars.\\n\\nDriving used to be considered the most popular way to get around town from point A to point B and back. But now, with a push to limit personal car usage, a positive switch is happening to where more and more people are no longer relying on their vehicles to move aboutinstead bikes, subways and buses, and even just our own two feet are our means of transportation. This \"smart planning\" reduces green house gases along with traffic congestion, and also promotes a simpler, healthier lifestyle.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \n","1376  As we all know cars are a big part of our society today. However cars have a bigger impact than we think. Some people can't live without there car. Some people can go their whole life without a car. We may not think about it however there are multiple advantages to not using a car. When we limit our car use it saves the earth also it i said that it takes away a heap load of stress and it saves people money. Just think about it, one day without the use of cars. How would that be?\\n\\nWe we think of saving the earth we think of recycling, reusing things, and reducing. Did you know that passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gases and up to 50 percent in some car intensive areas in the United States.According to \"In German suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars\" By: Elisabeth Rosenthal. In Paris there pollution was almost record setting and so they ordered that evennumbered license plates leave their cars at home or pay a fine of 31. Almost 4000 drivers were fined that day and 27 got their cars impounded. Most of the cars in Paris are diesel ran so the smog is worse. If they would cut down on their car use it would lower the smog.\\n\\nYou might not think of it but if we limited the use of cars it relieves stress. According to \"In German Suburb, Life Goes on Without Cars\", In Vauban, Germany they have given up their cars. Vaubans streets are completly car free. 70 percent of vaughn's families do not own cars and 57 percent sold a car to move there. Heidrun Walter said\"When I had a car I was always tense. Im much happierthis way\". According to \"Carfree dat in spinning into a big hit in Bogota\" by Andrew Selsky in Bogota,Columbia they have been without cars for 3 years. Also Carlos Arturo Plaza said \"It's a good opportunit totake awat stresss and lower the air pollution\".\\n\\nAccording to \"The End of Car Culture\" by: Elisabeth Rosenthal recent studies show that Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less and getting fewer licences as each year goes by. The number of miles driven in the United States peaked in 2005 and dropped steadily afterwards, according to an analysis by Doug Short of Adivor Perspectives. People who stopped driving there cars as a result of hard times may not find a reason to go back to driving if they are saving money.\\n\\nSo I believe that they're many reason to have a car. However they're many advantages to limiting your car use. You can think of yourself as doing a good deed to the earth when walking somewhere or riding your bike are catching the bus. You can have a clear mind and seize stressing so much. Also you can save money I think that everybody likes to save money one way or another. Instead of drivng your car to the mall you can save that money and catch the bus to the mall and buy that new purse that you have been dying to get.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 \n","1377  Cars have been around since the 1800's and have been popular ever since.

Because of limited car usage, people are helping the environment and benefiting themselves.\\n\\nCars emit pollution which harm our health and the environment's health.\\n\\n\"...Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe... and up to 50 percent in some carintensive areas in the United States.\" Cars make up a large amount of the emissions that do harm to the environment. When car usage is limited, less people drive, which in turn limits pollution. \"... but also in the developing world, where emissions from an increasing number of private cars are owned by the burgeoning middle class are choking cities.\" Again we see that cars are polluting our world, and it's caused by us. \" it will have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the environment, since transportation is the second largest source of America's emissions, just behind power plants.\" Cars and other transportation are releasing emissions which are harming the environment. Limited car usage clears up the pollution which helps us and the environment stay healthy.\\n\\nMany people are taking up new ways of transportation due to bans and such which are due to limits on car usage. They are taking public transportation, walking, carpooling, and so on. All of these methods of alternative transportation are beneficial. \"They organize their summer jobs and social life around where they can walk or take public transportation or carpool with friends.\" It is better to limit car usage because not only are you helping the environment, but you're also saving money and helping yourself out. Due to the lower amount of people who buy cars because of limited car usage, car corporations are also changing. \"He proposed partnering with the telecommunications industry to create cities in which pedestrian, bicycle, private cars, commercial and public transportation traffic are woven into a connected network to save time, conserve resources, lower emissions and improve safety.' \" The way people live will benefit from lower car usage. Our lifes will be much safer. Although some people may be upset if they can't drive their cars when they want, in the long run it benefits all of the community.\\n\\nAs bans continued to be passed and people are choosing to walk or take the bus instead, limted car usage continues. We can see that it is beneficial to us and will help our environment in the long run. Limited car usage is truely a good thing for us and will hopefully continue.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  \n","\n","      generated  prompt_id  source  \n","0     0          0          Kaggle  \n","1     0          0          Kaggle  \n","2     0          0          Kaggle  \n","3     0          0          Kaggle  \n","4     0          0          Kaggle  \n","...  ..         ..             ...  \n","1373  0          1          Kaggle  \n","1374  0          0          Kaggle  \n","1375  0          0          Kaggle  \n","1376  0          0          Kaggle  \n","1377  0          0          Kaggle  \n","\n","[1378 rows x 4 columns]"],"text/html":["\n","  <div id=\"df-cd5c761c-9a69-49af-b0d9-0f87c3d822f9\" class=\"colab-df-container\">\n","    <div>\n","<style scoped>\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {\n","        vertical-align: middle;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th {\n","        vertical-align: top;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe thead th {\n","        text-align: right;\n","    }\n","</style>\n","<table border=\"1\" class=\"dataframe\">\n","  <thead>\n","    <tr style=\"text-align: right;\">\n","      <th></th>\n","      <th>text</th>\n","      <th>generated</th>\n","      <th>prompt_id</th>\n","      <th>source</th>\n","    </tr>\n","  </thead>\n","  <tbody>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>0</th>\n","      <td>Cars. Cars have been around since they became famous in the 1900s, when Henry Ford created and built the first ModelT. Cars have played a major role in our every day lives since then. But now, people are starting to question if limiting car usage would be a good thing. To me, limiting the use of cars might be a good thing to do.\\n\\nIn like matter of this, article, \"In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars,\" by Elizabeth Rosenthal states, how automobiles are the linchpin of suburbs, where middle class families from either Shanghai or Chicago tend to make their homes. Experts say how this is a huge impediment to current efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from tailpipe. Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe...and up to 50 percent in some carintensive areas in the United States. Cars are the main reason for the greenhouse gas emissions because of a lot of people driving them around all the time getting where they need to go. Article, \"Paris bans driving due to smog,\" by Robert Duffer says, how Paris, after days of nearrecord pollution, enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city. It also says, how on Monday, motorist with evennumbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at home or be fined a 22euro fine 31. The same order would be applied to oddnumbered plates the following day. Cars are the reason for polluting entire cities like Paris. This shows how bad cars can be because, of all the pollution that they can cause to an entire city.\\n\\nLikewise, in the article, \"Carfree day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota,\" by Andrew Selsky says, how programs that's set to spread to other countries, millions of Columbians hiked, biked, skated, or took the bus to work during a carfree day, leaving streets of this capital city eerily devoid of traffic jams. It was the third straight year cars have been banned with only buses and taxis permitted for the Day Without Cars in the capital city of 7 million. People like the idea of having carfree days because, it allows them to lesson the pollution that cars put out of their exhaust from people driving all the time. The article also tells how parks and sports centers have bustled throughout the city uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks rushhour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic and new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up. Having no cars has been good for the country of Columbia because, it has aloud them to repair things that have needed repairs for a long time, traffic jams have gone down, and restaurants and shopping districts have popped up, all due to the fact of having less cars around.\\n\\nIn conclusion, the use of less cars and having carfree days, have had a big impact on the environment of cities because, it is cutting down the air pollution that the cars have majorly polluted, it has aloud countries like Columbia to repair sidewalks, and cut down traffic jams. Limiting the use of cars would be a good thing for America. So we should limit the use of cars by maybe riding a bike, or maybe walking somewhere that isn't that far from you and doesn't need the use of a car to get you there. To me, limiting the use of cars might be a good thing to do.</td>\n","      <td>0</td>\n","      <td>0</td>\n","      <td>Kaggle</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>1</th>\n","      <td>Transportation is a large necessity in most countries worldwide. With no doubt, cars, buses, and other means of transportation make going from place to place easier and faster. However there's always a negative pollution. Although mobile transportation are a huge part of daily lives, we are endangering the Earth with harmful greenhouse gases, which could be suppressed.\\n\\nA small suburb community in Germany called Vauban, has started a \"carfree\" lifestyle. In this city, markets and stores are placed nearby homes, instead of being located by farend highways. Although Vauban is not completely carfree, 70% of Vauban families do not own cars Even a large 57% of families stated to have sold their cars to move to Vauban. Some families have even said to be less stressed depending on car transportation. Cars are responsible for about 12% of greenhouse gases, and can even be up to 50% in some carintensive areas in the United States.\\n\\nAnother insight to reduced car zones brings Paris' incident with smog. Paris' officials created a system that would in fact lower smog rates. On Monday, the motorists with evennumbered license plates numbers would be ordered to leave their cars at home, or they would suffer a fine. Same rule would occur on Tuesday, except motorists with oddnumbered license plates were targeted with fines. Congestion, or traffic, was reduced by 60% after five days of intense smog. Diesel fuel played a huge part in this pollution, having the fact that 67% of vehicles in France are of Diesel fuel. The impact of the clearing of smog, resided in banning the Tuesday rule of odd license plates.\\n\\nCould you imagine a day without seeing a single car being used? This phenomenon occurs once a year in Bogota, Colombia. With the exception of buses and taxis being used, cars are to be left unattended for an entire day. Having a carfree day just once a year can even reduce the pollution slightly. The day without cars is part of a campaign that originated in Bogota in the mid 1990s. This campaign has renewed and constructed numerous bicycle paths and sidewalks all over the city. Parks and sports centers have also sprung from this campaign. Devoting your time to a carfree lifestyle has it's hassles, but in hindsight, it has it's benefits.\\n\\nTo conclude, living a carfree lifestyle does not seem like a possibility in this day and age, however managing the use of cars and pollution is something every country should take time investing in. Think about how much of an impact it would be if everywhere worldwide would take part in airpollution reduction. Mobile transportation is lifestyle in a sense, and being dependent on cars or other means of transportation can impact the health of the Earth and even ourselves.</td>\n","      <td>0</td>\n","      <td>0</td>\n","      <td>Kaggle</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>2</th>\n","      <td>\"America's love affair with it's vehicles seems to be cooling\" says Elisabeth rosenthal. To understand rosenthal's perspective, it is easier to suggest that America's car usage is decreasing slowly. This isn't necessarily bad in the sense that it has certain positive effects. The advantages of limiting car usage includes an increase in security and health, along with a decrease in pollution and dependence.\\n\\nFirstly, when car usage is limited security and health is more likely to be guaranteed. The feeling of being secure is highly important to individuals everywhere. For example, many people in colombia used public transportation during a car free day \"leaving the streets of this capital city \", according to Andrew Selsky, \"eerily devoid of traffic jams\". The complications that stem from traffic jams end with a feeling of confidence. The plan to get from point A to B was more simple just a second ago. This complication in your personal plans leads you to become stressed as a feeling of doubt overcomes all thoughts. If car usage was limited, there would be a control on how much traffic accumulates thus minimizing chance of stress. As Heidrun Walter states \"when i had a car i was always tense. I'm much happier this way\". not only does car usage minimize conditions detrimental to health, it also enlarges your capacity for exercise. The main purpose of the car is to get someone from one place to another. when an important job takes over your personal life, it becomes difficult to do things most enjoyed in life. limits on car usage forces you to stay in shape. According to Andrew Selsky \"parks and sports centers also have bloomed throughout the city\". Less cars means healthier and natural situations. With parks and sport centers becoming more efficient, it becomes easier to find a more physically active population. Overall, less usage on cars minimizes stress and increases health.\\n\\nSecondly, limting car usage becomes beneficial to the environment. Now a days people have become annoyed with others who care so passionately about the environment. If you look behind their constant cries for action, there are solid facts. Yespollution is bad for the environment. Yes a bad envorment means unhealthy living. Yes cars are one of the main contributors to pollution in the environment. A pattern of less car usage, as Elisabeth Rosenthal states \"will have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the environment\". The less use of cars, the less pollution in the environment. One must observe limiting car usage as an opportunity to create a cleaner world and better future. The effects of pollution in the environment is completley dangerous and we, the car users, are to blame.\\n\\nAdditionally, it would lower the dependence on cars. Many people today find that their car is so useful. While it has many features and is a form of transportation, many do not figure what they would do if they did not have such a possesion. The development of people and their interaction with technology has left a wide gap between historic, natural ways and what is thought of as modern society. Being dependent is not always good for individuals. As david goldberg says \"all our development since world war II has been centered on the car, and that will have to change\". Many people could disagree and wonder why it is necessary to change our ways especially if we are so highly devloped. If being developed means being dependent on a harmful machine, then it could not be effective devlopment. According to Elisabeth Rosenthal \"cashstrapped americans could not afford new cars, and the unemployed were't going to work anyway\". Many people can't have the precious luxury of private transportation in the first place. Those who have had it have become distant to a more natural society. Peope have become so use to having cars that they have become oblivious to the significant effects. With limits on car usage , these effcts could be controlled.\\n\\nTo conclude, the advantages of limiting car usage is an increase in health, along with a decrease in pollution, and less dependence on cars. limiting car usage is a positive way to enfore an organized and clean environment, and ensure health and security of those who live in it. This is one reason America can be reffered to as a succesful country. It is not that America has decreased use of vehicles, but the fact that they have done what is best for majority.</td>\n","      <td>0</td>\n","      <td>0</td>\n","      <td>Kaggle</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>3</th>\n","      <td>How often do you ride in a car? Do you drive a one or any other motor vehicle to work? The store? To the mall? Have you ever thought about how many people in the world do that exact same thing travel to every destination using a fuel powered motorvehicle. Not many people realize the intensive damage that they're doing when they turn their key in the ignition. What if you didn't drive to work today? If you're like any regular car user, the thought \"What?! I could never survive without my car!\" may run through your mind. It is possible though, to live without your main mean of transport. Just look at cities like cuban, Paris, and Bogota each one has in some way restricted their people's usage of cars and they actually enjoy it! If you limit your car usage, it can intern result in many advantages and benefits in yourself and in your community.\\n\\nA not so recognized benefit to giving up your car usage would be the positive consequences it has on your health. In source 1, Heidrun Walter states that \"When he had a car, he was always tense. He's much happier without it.\" Think about it, imagine all the angry road rage you experience while driving. That surely does not have a positive effect on your mood or health. Driving takes a copious amount of focus and mental activity, such as, trying to navigate, dealing with bad drivers, etc., that after a short period of time, you're stressed out and tired. In cities like New York and Paris, the population is high. This leads to congestion in the streets and excessive amounts of pollution. Warm layers of air, according to Robert Duffer in \"Paris bans driving due to smog,\" traps the car emissions. How is that healthy? He also states that Paris had to enforce a temporary driving ban after the pollution levels reached an all time record. After a few days of less driving the pollution went way down. Since people aren't driving, they have to find other means of transport. This could include walking, biking, or skating to destinations. Those are all physical excercises! Your body is getting to work out and you'll mentally feel fresher more than you would sitting in a car.\\n\\nTaking a break from driving also can help with the overall look of your city. Pollution doesn't cause the flowers to grow. It certainly doesn't smell nice. It sets a filter over the town and gives off a \"dirty\" vibe. With less driving, there is less nasty pollution being emitted, therefore leading to a cleaner community. In Elisabeth Rosenthal's article, \"In German Suburb, Life goes on Without Cars,\" she gives the good point that since there is a restriction on car and motor vehicle transportation, there is going to be more walkers. If you have tons of people taking the sidewalks instead of the roads, you might need a few more pathways and closer stores that are in walking distance. Andrew Selsky states that \"Parks and sports centers have bloomed throughout the city uneven pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks... and new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up.\" As stated previously, pollution is not benefiting the environment. Organizations such as the Envronmental Protection Agency in the U.S., are promoting \"car reduced\" communities, says Rosenthal. These communities have far less pollution and are much cleaner. Cities are also promoting this idea and are having days devoted to \"nocar driving.\" In Bogota, Colombia, they hold an anual \"carfree\" day where only buses and taxis are permitted. Any other drivers would be fined. Although fining someone for using a posession they own might ruffle some feathers, it did have a successful turn out and significantly reduced the \"smog.\" In conclusion, although the idea of giving up our precious automobiles for walking to our destination might sound impossible, it's not. Reducing our driving can lead to many benefits and advantages in our daily lives. These include an increase in health, an improved look to our cities, and an improved environment all around us.</td>\n","      <td>0</td>\n","      <td>0</td>\n","      <td>Kaggle</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>4</th>\n","      <td>Cars are a wonderful thing. They are perhaps one of the worlds greatest advancements and technologies. Cars get us from point a to point i. That is exactly what we want isnt it? We as humans want to get from one place to anther as fast as possiile. Cars are a suitaile to do that. They get us across the city in a matter of minutes. Much faster than anyhting else we have. A train isnt going to get me across the city as fast as my car is and neither is a puilic ius, iut those other forms of transportation just might ie the way to go. Don't get me wrong, cars are an aisolutly amazing thing iut, mayie they just cause way to much stress, and mayie they hurt our environment in ways that we don't think they will. With a ius or a train you do not have to worry aiout washing your car or getting frustrated when stuck in a iad traffic jam on I4. Also there is not as much pollution in air hurting our environment. You might not think so, iut there are many advantages to limiting our car usage.\\n\\nOne advantage that not only humans would ienefit from, iut also plants and animals is that there would ie a lot less pollution in the air hurting out environment. Right now our cars give off gases that are extremely harmful towards our environment. These gases are called green house gases and come out of the exhaust pipes in our cars. Your car alone docent give off much gas iut collectively, our cars give off enormous amounts of gases. This is especially true in iig cities like France. In France, their pollution level was so high it was record ireaking. due to that france decided to enforce a partial ian on cars. This is descriied in the second article \" Paris ians driving due to smog\", iy Roiert Duffer, \" On Monday motorists with evennumiered license plates were orderd to leave their cars at home or suffer a 22euro fine 31. The same would apply to oddnumiered plates the following day.\" After France limited driving there congestion was down iy 60 percent. \" Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France\". So after five days of intense smog, 60 percent of it was clear after not using cars for only a little while. Even across the world in Bogota, columiia they are limiting driving and reducing smog levels. In the third article \"carfree day is spinning into a iig hit in Bogota\", iy Andrew Selsky, it descriies the annual carfree day they have to reduce smog. \" the goal is to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog\". So all over the world people are relizing that without cars, we are insuring the safety and well ieing of our environment.\\n\\nThe second advantage that would come with limiting car use is less stress. Everyone knows that driving a car causes emence amounts of stress. Getting caught in traffic is a major cause of stress in someones life. having to repeating wash your car just to get it dirt again causes stress. Having people in the iack of your car screaming and yelling all while music is ilasting, causes stress. So oiviously driving causes stress. If we were to limit our car usage we would not ie as stressed as we usually are. There would ie no traffic, no car washes and no one screaming in a small confineded space. In the first article \" In German Suiuri, life goes on without cars\", iy Elisaieth Rosenthal, a citizen named humdrum Walter, states \" When i had a car i was always tense. I'm much happier this way\". So with out the stress of a car humdrum Walter is a looser and happier person, less stress equals happier person. In the third article, \" Carfree dai is spinning into a iig hit in Bogota\", iy Andrew Selsky, it states \" It's a good opportunity to take away stress...\". If we have the opportunity to take away stress, why not take it. It is a huge advantage in our lives to limit driving if it takes away stress. No one wants stress, no one needs stress, and if we have an opportunity to take some of the stress away, take that opportunity.\\n\\nIn conclusion, there are many advantages to limiting car use, one ieing theat we get to help the environment and two ieing that it helps reduce stress. Our environment is already screwed up in so many ways, if we can help it to iecome the healthy environment it once was, then do it. Stress is proven to impare your personal health, no one wants to ie unhealthy and no one wants stress in their life. If you want the environment to get ietter and you want to reduce stress in your life then take this advantage and impliment it. Some might not think that this is an advantage, iut i just explained that it is a clear advantege that has ieen proved to help the enviornment and reduce stress. Limiting car use is a very effective advantage that really does work in more than one place.</td>\n","      <td>0</td>\n","      <td>0</td>\n","      <td>Kaggle</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>...</th>\n","      <td>...</td>\n","      <td>...</td>\n","      <td>...</td>\n","      <td>...</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>1373</th>\n","      <td>There has been a fuss about the Elector College. Many people get confused about how it works and if they're satisfied with the whole process. Show we \"abolish\" the Elector College? Should we keep it? Honestly we should keep it. We the peope have more then enough control on who is chosen for the president of the United States Of America. We don't really vote for the president but our vote impacts the decision.\\n\\nMany citizens of the United States Of America think their vote doesn matter, it does. Why? Well, first the government is runned by the people. Its very rare to not get the president that has the most popular votes, the last time when the president wasn't chosen was in 1888. It's less likely for the president with the most votes to lose the election. For example, Obama received 61.7 percent of the elector votes compared to only 51.3 percent of the popular votes cast for him and rodney. Plus, almost all states award elector votes on a winnertakeitall basis.\\n\\nPerhaps, there was no system. Would it be simpler? Yes it would but we have to also be fair, there is 538 electors and a majority of 270 elector votes is required to elect the president. When you are voting for the president ypu want to win,you are actually voting for your canidate's elector. How does the system work? First it's the process that has the selection of the electors , the meeting of the electors where they vote for the president and vice president , and last but not least the counting of electoral votes by congress. Obviously it is kind of confusing because it would be much simpler if the winner would be the one with the most popular votes.\\n\\nDid you know that the Elector College avoids the problem of elections? They do due to how much pressure the candidte can go through. It can easily complicate the presidential process. For instance, Nixon in 1968 and Clinton in 1992 both had only a 43 percent plurality of the popular votes, while winning a majority in the Elector College 301 and 370 elector votes exactly. When avoiding the elections and campaigns , there a better chance of clear winner.\\n\\nSo there you have it,three main reason's why we should keep the Elector College.

Such as putting a lot less pollution in the air and having your stress level go down letting you spend time with your family and friends. When we put pollution in the air it ruins our beautiful ecosystem. When driving a car you have to stress about how much gas you have or you stress about if you are going over the speed limit.\\n\\nThe first advantage to not having cars is we limit the amount of pollution in the air. Did you know that in Europe you cause up to twelve percent of its greenhouse gas, and in the US you cause up to fifty percent of that gas, that just goes in the air causing the air that we breath to become polluted. Some ways to prevent this is to carpool with someone or just to walk there and not drive, you get to help the environment and you get your daily workout as well. Some countries have taking the role of taxing anyone who wants to use a car. Like in France, who has a tax policy that makes people choose diesel instead of regular gasoline. France has over sixtyseven percent of cars that run on diesel fuel. Paris has banned the use of cars do to the huge amount of smog they are having.\\n\\nThe second advantage for limiting the usage of cars is lowering your stress level and being able to spend time with family and friends. To help with this some countries have programs that provide people with bikes and other forms of transportation in order for people to get to work. When people don't drive cars and walk with their kids to drop them off at school then go to work it keeps the traffic and all the stress that comes with it down to an all time low. When summer time comes around teens can organize what they do and who they hang out with based on where they are and how far they want to walk to get there.\\n\\nSo limiting the usage of cars has many significant advantages like less pollution and being able to spend time with family and friends while lowering your stress level. So before you get in your car and drive to wherever you are going just take a second and think, can I walk there instead.</td>\n","      <td>0</td>\n","      <td>0</td>\n","      <td>Kaggle</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>1375</th>\n","      <td>There's a new trend that has been developing for years now, and soon will be in full throttle affect. The mass amount of pollution being produced worldwide over the years has been at terrifying levels, up until the last five to ten years. Although not the first cause of the pollution, gases emitted from transportation is the second largest contributed to this \"green house gas\" issue going on, according to source 4. An idea to hinder this growing issue and potentially put the pollution levels at a decline is the effort to limit personal car usage. By doing this, we inhabitants of the world are able to help clear the air, reduce congestion on the streets, and live a simpler, more cost efficient lifestyle.\\n\\nPolution, as we know, is an ongoing trend that is proving lethal to our environment. Factories and power plants are the number one cause of pollution in the world. This is almost inevitable, since we have yet to develop a way to produce in mass amounts in a clean way. However, what we can have a part in is limiting the personal car usage to promote cleaner air. Public transportation, carpooling, and hybridelectric cars have been seen as the alternative to owning personal cars. Those options are also seen as the solution, considering their contribution to the act since \"the number of miles driven per person was nearly 9 percent below the peak of 2005\" source 4. Reducing the amout of miles driven links to the amout of dangerous gases emitted into the air, therefor \"having cleaner air.\" Rush hour traffic is obnoxious and is the least fun part of driving. Encouraging people to drive less and either walk, bike, or use public transportation will help end the long waits sitting bumpertobumper on the roads. In France, a study was done where fines were placed on people who drove by themselves or with only one passenger excluding hybrids and \"plug in\" cars. According to the source, \"congestion was down 60 percent.\" Just a week of not driving with personal gasoline or diesel cars proved to be extremely beneficial in clearing out the streets, making for easier courses to work. The concept is truly simple. We use less cars, there's less people on the street, and you can get to and fro much faster and without hassle. Reducing the number of cars on the street is also a goodway to inspire motor companies to be inventive. Losing business will ultimately result in extermination of the business, unless the corporation is able to come up with new products to satisfy the consumer. Mitsubishi is a automotive company that also makes air conditioners. According to source 4, Ford and Mercedes are \"rebranding\" themselves to comply with the new trend.\\n\\nAlmost everyone wants to live a clean, healthy and simple lifestyle and participation in limiting the number of cars driven daily is a very easy way to do so. Heidrun Walter, a media trainer and mother of two, said,\"When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way\" source 1. This refers to the successful suburban trial in Vauban, Germany to no longer own cars. Parking on the street, personal garages, and driveways in general are seen as taboo in the living district near France and Switzerland's border source 1. Very few people own cars, let alone drive them. Not only does lowering the usage of cars help the environment and make the journey to wherever you're going much less complicated, it also initiates the restoration of things considered not as important such as sidewalks, parks, and public transport systems. The more people using the utilities, the more cities will fund them and make the experience more enjoyable. In Bogata, the \"day without cars\" campaign has led to 118 miles of bycle paths being constructed source 3. The chain of events will lead to more and more people utilizing their bikes and feet to get around, instead of cars.\\n\\nDriving used to be considered the most popular way to get around town from point A to point B and back. But now, with a push to limit personal car usage, a positive switch is happening to where more and more people are no longer relying on their vehicles to move aboutinstead bikes, subways and buses, and even just our own two feet are our means of transportation. This \"smart planning\" reduces green house gases along with traffic congestion, and also promotes a simpler, healthier lifestyle.</td>\n","      <td>0</td>\n","      <td>0</td>\n","      <td>Kaggle</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>1376</th>\n","      <td>As we all know cars are a big part of our society today. However cars have a bigger impact than we think. Some people can't live without there car. Some people can go their whole life without a car. We may not think about it however there are multiple advantages to not using a car. When we limit our car use it saves the earth also it i said that it takes away a heap load of stress and it saves people money. Just think about it, one day without the use of cars. How would that be?\\n\\nWe we think of saving the earth we think of recycling, reusing things, and reducing. Did you know that passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gases and up to 50 percent in some car intensive areas in the United States.According to \"In German suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars\" By: Elisabeth Rosenthal. In Paris there pollution was almost record setting and so they ordered that evennumbered license plates leave their cars at home or pay a fine of 31. Almost 4000 drivers were fined that day and 27 got their cars impounded. Most of the cars in Paris are diesel ran so the smog is worse. If they would cut down on their car use it would lower the smog.\\n\\nYou might not think of it but if we limited the use of cars it relieves stress. According to \"In German Suburb, Life Goes on Without Cars\", In Vauban, Germany they have given up their cars. Vaubans streets are completly car free. 70 percent of vaughn's families do not own cars and 57 percent sold a car to move there. Heidrun Walter said\"When I had a car I was always tense. Im much happierthis way\". According to \"Carfree dat in spinning into a big hit in Bogota\" by Andrew Selsky in Bogota,Columbia they have been without cars for 3 years. Also Carlos Arturo Plaza said \"It's a good opportunit totake awat stresss and lower the air pollution\".\\n\\nAccording to \"The End of Car Culture\" by: Elisabeth Rosenthal recent studies show that Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less and getting fewer licences as each year goes by. The number of miles driven in the United States peaked in 2005 and dropped steadily afterwards, according to an analysis by Doug Short of Adivor Perspectives. People who stopped driving there cars as a result of hard times may not find a reason to go back to driving if they are saving money.\\n\\nSo I believe that they're many reason to have a car. However they're many advantages to limiting your car use. You can think of yourself as doing a good deed to the earth when walking somewhere or riding your bike are catching the bus. You can have a clear mind and seize stressing so much. Also you can save money I think that everybody likes to save money one way or another. Instead of drivng your car to the mall you can save that money and catch the bus to the mall and buy that new purse that you have been dying to get.</td>\n","      <td>0</td>\n","      <td>0</td>\n","      <td>Kaggle</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>1377</th>\n","      <td>Cars have been around since the 1800's and have been popular ever since. Although, in recent years the number of cars bought and licenses attained have been dropping. Car usage has also dropped, which is a good thing. Because of limited car usage, people are helping the environment and benefiting themselves.\\n\\nCars emit pollution which harm our health and the environment's health.\\n\\n\"...Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe... and up to 50 percent in some carintensive areas in the United States.\" Cars make up a large amount of the emissions that do harm to the environment. When car usage is limited, less people drive, which in turn limits pollution. \"... but also in the developing world, where emissions from an increasing number of private cars are owned by the burgeoning middle class are choking cities.\" Again we see that cars are polluting our world, and it's caused by us. \" it will have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the environment, since transportation is the second largest source of America's emissions, just behind power plants.\" Cars and other transportation are releasing emissions which are harming the environment. Limited car usage clears up the pollution which helps us and the environment stay healthy.\\n\\nMany people are taking up new ways of transportation due to bans and such which are due to limits on car usage. They are taking public transportation, walking, carpooling, and so on. All of these methods of alternative transportation are beneficial. \"They organize their summer jobs and social life around where they can walk or take public transportation or carpool with friends.\" It is better to limit car usage because not only are you helping the environment, but you're also saving money and helping yourself out. Due to the lower amount of people who buy cars because of limited car usage, car corporations are also changing. \"He proposed partnering with the telecommunications industry to create cities in which pedestrian, bicycle, private cars, commercial and public transportation traffic are woven into a connected network to save time, conserve resources, lower emissions and improve safety.' \" The way people live will benefit from lower car usage. Our lifes will be much safer. Although some people may be upset if they can't drive their cars when they want, in the long run it benefits all of the community.\\n\\nAs bans continued to be passed and people are choosing to walk or take the bus instead, limted car usage continues. We can see that it is beneficial to us and will help our environment in the long run.

It is an amazing thing to think if every person doesn't drive in one big city that it saves so much pollution going in to the air. Another thing to think about is if everyone in a city didn't drive and walked everywhere, more people would stay healthier by staying in shape. Some people think that owning a car is more stressful than just walking everywhere. If you don't own a car you don't have to pay for insurance, don't have to pay for gas, and don't have to pay for repairs when something goes wrong in a vehicle. To me it sounds like there is a lot of advantages in limiting car use.\\n\\nOne solid reason why not using cars as much is the pollution going in the air. In Paris, France motorists with even numbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at their house or else they would be fined. The next day odd numbered license plates motorists had to leave their vehicles at home. It was a hardship at first to get people to follow these new rules, but after about five days everything started to cool down. The pollution had dropped 60 percent in Paris which is exactly what the city was looking for. Limiting the car usage didn't just save pollution from going in the air, but also there wasn't as much traffic as there usually was. It also made Paris a safer place to be outside and not damage the citizens lungs. The capital city of France also made transportation free MondayFriday to help the cause. Soon enough people that had both license plates could drive on the same day.\\n\\nIn Bogota, Colombia they do a car free day that is becoming popular in that part of the world. It is awesome to think there are 7 million people in that city and none of them are using a car. People that violated this goal on this day were charged a 25 fine. People from other countries came to see how this day worked and they loved it. The mayor of Asuncion, Paraguay said \\\"These people are generating a revolutionary change, and this is crossing borders.\\\" You can just imagine all the benefits of everyone not using a car in a city for a whole day. Restaurants and parks would be visited and used more and everyone would be getting more exercise. All in all this idea was genius.\\n\\nAs you can see limiting car usage can help out the area big time that it is taking place. It is better breathing air, businesses like restaurants and parks would be used more and grow steadily, and the city would be taken care of better.\",\n          \"Limiting car usage could have many advantages on our planet. Many cities, such as Vauban in Germany, have given up on using cars to help the world around them. \\\"vaughn's streets are completely carfree,except the main thoroughfare, where the tram to downtown Freiburg runs, and a few streets on one edge of the community.\\\" There is a movement going on called, \\\"smart planning\\\" and Vauban is just one example of a growing trend in Europe of limiting auto use. The article says that passenger cars are responsible for twelve percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe. It seems that the people in Europe are realizing that so much car usage is harming their environment, and they are trying to set a trend for other countries like the United States to follow to limit using cars.\\n\\nHow much people use their cars is very important. Polluted air is a very widespread problem in many regions of the world. Paris had days of nearrecord pollution, and decided to enforce a partial driving ban to try to help clear the air of the city. The article says that almost 4,000 drivers were fined, and twentyseven had their cars impounded for their reaction to the fine. \\\"Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France, after five days of intensifying smog.\\\" The driving ban helped clear the smog, because it reduced car emissions. Paris has more smog than many other European capitals, which is why reducing how much citizens drive their cars is a good idea.\\n\\nSome cities have days that are completely car free. Bogota, Colombia is one of them. They have been having a Day Without Cars for three straight years. Cars are banned for the day and buses and taxis are the only exception. The city holds about 7 million people, and had a large turnout. \\\"It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution,\\\" said businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza. The mayor of Asuncion, Paraguay even said that, \\\"These people are generating a revolutionary change, and this is crossing borders.\\\" The Day Without Cars has even helped stores and sports center come up throughout the city. Instead of shopping centers along a highway, those stores are now in the city and easy to get to without having to use a car.\\n\\nResearchers have been studying America's ways of car usage and driving. America is home to the first cars like the Model T, or \\\"Mustang Sally.\\\" Vehichles have always been a huge part of culture, but it seems now that that might not be the case anymore. \\\"As of April 2013, the number of miles driven per person was nearly 9 percent below the peak and equal to where the country was in January 1995.\\\" Researchers are actually hoping that the pattern continues because it will have beneficial implications for carbon emissions on the environment. Transportation is the second largest source, behind power plants, of emissions. Many changes have now happened in America, which are making using cars not as important. \\\"With all these changes, people who stopped car commuting as a result of the recession may find less reason to resume the habit..\\\" The article says. If we could slow down the usage of cars and emission, maybe we could help the planet become a better place.\\n\\nSince the percentage of car usage has gone down in America, so has the percentage of getting a license. There has been a large drop in 1639 year olds getting a license, Mr. Sivak's research has found. Older people are also likely to retain their licenses as they age. Mr. Sivak and another man both have children of about the same age, 19 and 21, and live in busy cities where a car could be useful. Neither one of them has their licenses, even though they are interested, but they don't really see the need for one when they can use public transportation or carpool with their friends. The article says that a study last year has also found that driving by young people decreased 23 percent between 2001 and 2009. Whether or not this changes as these young people grow older, these decreases in driving are proving that cars might just not be as important as they used to be.\\n\\nOur planet is just continuing to get worse from emissions from cars. Some countries are starting to realize this and are working hard to limit car usage and have citizens rely just on public transportation, walking, or riding a bike. Bill Ford proposed partnering with the telecommunications industry to create cities in which, \\\"pedestrian, bicycle, private cars, commercial, and public transportation traffic are woven into a connected network to save time, conserve resources, lower emissions, and improve safety.\\\" Citizens all over the world can work together to reduce car usage and better improve our planet.\",\n          \"In this generation, our planet is getting filthier and filthier by the day. What many people are too late to realize is that we are the main cause of our dirty planet. Cars contribute to air pollution a lot. What's the only solution to this smog filled atmosphere? There are many, but limiting car usage will definitely be beneficial and highly advantageous. Limiting car usage will help reduce air pollution significantly, and will even help humans out too.\\n\\nWe breathe the air in our atmosphere. When you notice that our atmosphere is as dirty as it is, you really don't want to think about what you are putting into your lungs. The amount of air pollution is an extreme amount, and if not controlled soon, we will be in danger. An advantage of limiting car usage would be that the air pollution will be benefitted, and will be getting lower hopefully. As Robert Duffer states Paris of having \\\" intensifying smog.\\\" That should be very concerning news and should be a clear wake up call. Limiting car usage is definitely something our planet needs to look into. A healthier atmosphere is better than one filled with smog. The decrease of air pollution is just one of the many advantages of limiting car usage.\\n\\nLimiting car usage is also advantageous by taking away stress. Many people that drive all know what the pains are of being stuck in traffic. What if you don't wake up on time and you skip taking a shower, or skip eating breakfast, and speed as fast as you can to make it to work? It causes severe stress. From that point on in the day, you literally can't concentrate or focus and you just know it is going to be a rough day. Well, limiting car usage would take some stress away. See, super slow traffic , being late to work, skipping the most important meal of the day, it all just builds up into a lot of unneeded and unwanted stress. If people don't have to deal with congested highways, they could enjoy a nice walk to their job, or ride their bicycle. Doing this would instantly take away stress. \\\"It's a good opportunity to take away stress...\\\" says Carlos Arturo Plaza, a business manSelsky. There are cities that have tried having a day with no cars. It has worked in taking away stress, as you can see. Taking a bike ride or walking instead of driving a car is also beneficial because it's exercise.\\n\\nLimting car use has its benefits. People should be aware of the growing danger of air pollution, and limitng car usage will help reduce the amount of pollution. Also, it helps in taking away stress and clearing minds. It is not a bad idea to start limiting our car usage, for we will receive the benefits of decreased car usage.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"generated\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 1,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          1,\n          0\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"prompt_id\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 1,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          1,\n          0\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"source\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Kaggle\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":5}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# Data Augmentation\n","The samples provided by Kaggle are not enough to properly train and test our model.\n","\n","We download some DAIGT datasets (\"Detection of AI-Generated Texts\") from Kaggle platform and we use them to assemble bigger datasets."],"metadata":{"id":"cdg-n5nSy31V"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["#Load extra data\n","filenames2=[]\n","data_dir=os.path.join(working_dir, 'DAIGT_datasets') #directory of DAIGT datasets\n","for f in os.listdir(data_dir): #inspect folder's content\n","    if f[-4:]=='.csv': #dataset are stored in the .csv format\n","      print('-', f)\n","      filenames2.append(f)\n","\n","print('\\n')\n","\n","extra=[] #array of pandas dataframes containing the DAIGT datasets downloaded from Kaggle\n","for i in range(len(filenames2)):\n","   extra.append(load_dataframe_and_print_info(data_dir, filenames2[i]))"],"metadata":{"id":"um8dXkZCrtUE","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1718720035075,"user_tz":-120,"elapsed":35381,"user":{"displayName":"Francesco Mazzei","userId":"14521237292566136102"}},"outputId":"1e5162f1-88e6-41e5-e0af-d162c2847e3e"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["- train_v3_drcat_01.csv\n","- train_v3_drcat_02.csv\n","- train_v4_drcat_01.csv\n","- daigt_magic_generations.csv\n","\n","\n","Dataset train_v3_drcat_01.csv\n","<class 'pandas.core.frame.DataFrame'>\n","RangeIndex: 65508 entries, 0 to 65507\n","Data columns (total 5 columns):\n"," #

Cars. Cars have been around since they became famous in the 1900s, when Henry Ford created and built the first ModelT. Cars have played a major role in our every day lives since then. But now, people are starting to question if limiting car usage would be a good thing. To me, limiting the use of cars might be a good thing to do.\\n\\nIn like matter of this, article, \"In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars,\" by Elizabeth Rosenthal states, how automobiles are the linchpin of suburbs, where middle class families from either Shanghai or Chicago tend to make their homes. Experts say how this is a huge impediment to current efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from tailpipe. Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe...and up to 50 percent in some carintensive areas in the United States. Cars are the main reason for the greenhouse gas emissions because of a lot of people driving them around all the time getting where they need to go. Article, \"Paris bans driving due to smog,\" by Robert Duffer says, how Paris, after days of nearrecord pollution, enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city. It also says, how on Monday, motorist with evennumbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at home or be fined a 22euro fine 31. The same order would be applied to oddnumbered plates the following day. Cars are the reason for polluting entire cities like Paris. This shows how bad cars can be because, of all the pollution that they can cause to an entire city.\\n\\nLikewise, in the article, \"Carfree day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota,\" by Andrew Selsky says, how programs that's set to spread to other countries, millions of Columbians hiked, biked, skated, or took the bus to work during a carfree day, leaving streets of this capital city eerily devoid of traffic jams. It was the third straight year cars have been banned with only buses and taxis permitted for the Day Without Cars in the capital city of 7 million. People like the idea of having carfree days because, it allows them to lesson the pollution that cars put out of their exhaust from people driving all the time. The article also tells how parks and sports centers have bustled throughout the city uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks rushhour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic and new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up. Having no cars has been good for the country of Columbia because, it has aloud them to repair things that have needed repairs for a long time, traffic jams have gone down, and restaurants and shopping districts have popped up, all due to the fact of having less cars around.\\n\\nIn conclusion, the use of less cars and having carfree days, have had a big impact on the environment of cities because, it is cutting down the air pollution that the cars have majorly polluted, it has aloud countries like Columbia to repair sidewalks, and cut down traffic jams. Limiting the use of cars would be a good thing for America. So we should limit the use of cars by maybe riding a bike, or maybe walking somewhere that isn't that far from you and doesn't need the use of a car to get you there. To me, limiting the use of cars might be a good thing to do.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    \n","1      Transportation is a large necessity in most countries worldwide. With no doubt, cars, buses, and other means of transportation make going from place to place easier and faster. However there's always a negative pollution. Although mobile transportation are a huge part of daily lives, we are endangering the Earth with harmful greenhouse gases, which could be suppressed.\\n\\nA small suburb community in Germany called Vauban, has started a \"carfree\" lifestyle. In this city, markets and stores are placed nearby homes, instead of being located by farend highways. Although Vauban is not completely carfree, 70% of Vauban families do not own cars Even a large 57% of families stated to have sold their cars to move to Vauban. Some families have even said to be less stressed depending on car transportation. Cars are responsible for about 12% of greenhouse gases, and can even be up to 50% in some carintensive areas in the United States.\\n\\nAnother insight to reduced car zones brings Paris' incident with smog. Paris' officials created a system that would in fact lower smog rates. On Monday, the motorists with evennumbered license plates numbers would be ordered to leave their cars at home, or they would suffer a fine. Same rule would occur on Tuesday, except motorists with oddnumbered license plates were targeted with fines. Congestion, or traffic, was reduced by 60% after five days of intense smog. Diesel fuel played a huge part in this pollution, having the fact that 67% of vehicles in France are of Diesel fuel. The impact of the clearing of smog, resided in banning the Tuesday rule of odd license plates.\\n\\nCould you imagine a day without seeing a single car being used? This phenomenon occurs once a year in Bogota, Colombia. With the exception of buses and taxis being used, cars are to be left unattended for an entire day. Having a carfree day just once a year can even reduce the pollution slightly. The day without cars is part of a campaign that originated in Bogota in the mid 1990s. This campaign has renewed and constructed numerous bicycle paths and sidewalks all over the city. Parks and sports centers have also sprung from this campaign. Devoting your time to a carfree lifestyle has it's hassles, but in hindsight, it has it's benefits.\\n\\nTo conclude, living a carfree lifestyle does not seem like a possibility in this day and age, however managing the use of cars and pollution is something every country should take time investing in. Think about how much of an impact it would be if everywhere worldwide would take part in airpollution reduction. Mobile transportation is lifestyle in a sense, and being dependent on cars or other means of transportation can impact the health of the Earth and even ourselves.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n","2      \"America's love affair with it's vehicles seems to be cooling\" says Elisabeth rosenthal. To understand rosenthal's perspective, it is easier to suggest that America's car usage is decreasing slowly. This isn't necessarily bad in the sense that it has certain positive effects. The advantages of limiting car usage includes an increase in security and health, along with a decrease in pollution and dependence.\\n\\nFirstly, when car usage is limited security and health is more likely to be guaranteed. The feeling of being secure is highly important to individuals everywhere. For example, many people in colombia used public transportation during a car free day \"leaving the streets of this capital city \", according to Andrew Selsky, \"eerily devoid of traffic jams\". The complications that stem from traffic jams end with a feeling of confidence. The plan to get from point A to B was more simple just a second ago. This complication in your personal plans leads you to become stressed as a feeling of doubt overcomes all thoughts. If car usage was limited, there would be a control on how much traffic accumulates thus minimizing chance of stress. As Heidrun Walter states \"when i had a car i was always tense. I'm much happier this way\". not only does car usage minimize conditions detrimental to health, it also enlarges your capacity for exercise. The main purpose of the car is to get someone from one place to another. when an important job takes over your personal life, it becomes difficult to do things most enjoyed in life. limits on car usage forces you to stay in shape. According to Andrew Selsky \"parks and sports centers also have bloomed throughout the city\". Less cars means healthier and natural situations. With parks and sport centers becoming more efficient, it becomes easier to find a more physically active population. Overall, less usage on cars minimizes stress and increases health.\\n\\nSecondly, limting car usage becomes beneficial to the environment. Now a days people have become annoyed with others who care so passionately about the environment. If you look behind their constant cries for action, there are solid facts. Yespollution is bad for the environment. Yes a bad envorment means unhealthy living. Yes cars are one of the main contributors to pollution in the environment. A pattern of less car usage, as Elisabeth Rosenthal states \"will have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the environment\". The less use of cars, the less pollution in the environment. One must observe limiting car usage as an opportunity to create a cleaner world and better future. The effects of pollution in the environment is completley dangerous and we, the car users, are to blame.\\n\\nAdditionally, it would lower the dependence on cars. Many people today find that their car is so useful. While it has many features and is a form of transportation, many do not figure what they would do if they did not have such a possesion. The development of people and their interaction with technology has left a wide gap between historic, natural ways and what is thought of as modern society. Being dependent is not always good for individuals. As david goldberg says \"all our development since world war II has been centered on the car, and that will have to change\". Many people could disagree and wonder why it is necessary to change our ways especially if we are so highly devloped. If being developed means being dependent on a harmful machine, then it could not be effective devlopment. According to Elisabeth Rosenthal \"cashstrapped americans could not afford new cars, and the unemployed were't going to work anyway\". Many people can't have the precious luxury of private transportation in the first place. Those who have had it have become distant to a more natural society. Peope have become so use to having cars that they have become oblivious to the significant effects. With limits on car usage , these effcts could be controlled.\\n\\nTo conclude, the advantages of limiting car usage is an increase in health, along with a decrease in pollution, and less dependence on cars. limiting car usage is a positive way to enfore an organized and clean environment, and ensure health and security of those who live in it. This is one reason America can be reffered to as a succesful country. It is not that America has decreased use of vehicles, but the fact that they have done what is best for majority.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               \n","3      How often do you ride in a car? Do you drive a one or any other motor vehicle to work? The store? To the mall? Have you ever thought about how many people in the world do that exact same thing travel to every destination using a fuel powered motorvehicle. Not many people realize the intensive damage that they're doing when they turn their key in the ignition. What if you didn't drive to work today? If you're like any regular car user, the thought \"What?! I could never survive without my car!\" may run through your mind. It is possible though, to live without your main mean of transport. Just look at cities like cuban, Paris, and Bogota each one has in some way restricted their people's usage of cars and they actually enjoy it! If you limit your car usage, it can intern result in many advantages and benefits in yourself and in your community.\\n\\nA not so recognized benefit to giving up your car usage would be the positive consequences it has on your health. In source 1, Heidrun Walter states that \"When he had a car, he was always tense. He's much happier without it.\" Think about it, imagine all the angry road rage you experience while driving. That surely does not have a positive effect on your mood or health. Driving takes a copious amount of focus and mental activity, such as, trying to navigate, dealing with bad drivers, etc., that after a short period of time, you're stressed out and tired. In cities like New York and Paris, the population is high. This leads to congestion in the streets and excessive amounts of pollution. Warm layers of air, according to Robert Duffer in \"Paris bans driving due to smog,\" traps the car emissions. How is that healthy? He also states that Paris had to enforce a temporary driving ban after the pollution levels reached an all time record. After a few days of less driving the pollution went way down. Since people aren't driving, they have to find other means of transport. This could include walking, biking, or skating to destinations. Those are all physical excercises! Your body is getting to work out and you'll mentally feel fresher more than you would sitting in a car.\\n\\nTaking a break from driving also can help with the overall look of your city. Pollution doesn't cause the flowers to grow. It certainly doesn't smell nice. It sets a filter over the town and gives off a \"dirty\" vibe. With less driving, there is less nasty pollution being emitted, therefore leading to a cleaner community. In Elisabeth Rosenthal's article, \"In German Suburb, Life goes on Without Cars,\" she gives the good point that since there is a restriction on car and motor vehicle transportation, there is going to be more walkers. If you have tons of people taking the sidewalks instead of the roads, you might need a few more pathways and closer stores that are in walking distance. Andrew Selsky states that \"Parks and sports centers have bloomed throughout the city uneven pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks... and new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up.\" As stated previously, pollution is not benefiting the environment. Organizations such as the Envronmental Protection Agency in the U.S., are promoting \"car reduced\" communities, says Rosenthal. These communities have far less pollution and are much cleaner. Cities are also promoting this idea and are having days devoted to \"nocar driving.\" In Bogota, Colombia, they hold an anual \"carfree\" day where only buses and taxis are permitted. Any other drivers would be fined. Although fining someone for using a posession they own might ruffle some feathers, it did have a successful turn out and significantly reduced the \"smog.\" In conclusion, although the idea of giving up our precious automobiles for walking to our destination might sound impossible, it's not. Reducing our driving can lead to many benefits and advantages in our daily lives. These include an increase in health, an improved look to our cities, and an improved environment all around us.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  \n","4      Cars are a wonderful thing. They are perhaps one of the worlds greatest advancements and technologies. Cars get us from point a to point i. That is exactly what we want isnt it? We as humans want to get from one place to anther as fast as possiile. Cars are a suitaile to do that. They get us across the city in a matter of minutes. Much faster than anyhting else we have. A train isnt going to get me across the city as fast as my car is and neither is a puilic ius, iut those other forms of transportation just might ie the way to go. Don't get me wrong, cars are an aisolutly amazing thing iut, mayie they just cause way to much stress, and mayie they hurt our environment in ways that we don't think they will. With a ius or a train you do not have to worry aiout washing your car or getting frustrated when stuck in a iad traffic jam on I4. Also there is not as much pollution in air hurting our environment. You might not think so, iut there are many advantages to limiting our car usage.\\n\\nOne advantage that not only humans would ienefit from, iut also plants and animals is that there would ie a lot less pollution in the air hurting out environment. Right now our cars give off gases that are extremely harmful towards our environment. These gases are called green house gases and come out of the exhaust pipes in our cars. Your car alone docent give off much gas iut collectively, our cars give off enormous amounts of gases. This is especially true in iig cities like France. In France, their pollution level was so high it was record ireaking. due to that france decided to enforce a partial ian on cars. This is descriied in the second article \" Paris ians driving due to smog\", iy Roiert Duffer, \" On Monday motorists with evennumiered license plates were orderd to leave their cars at home or suffer a 22euro fine 31. The same would apply to oddnumiered plates the following day.\" After France limited driving there congestion was down iy 60 percent. \" Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France\". So after five days of intense smog, 60 percent of it was clear after not using cars for only a little while. Even across the world in Bogota, columiia they are limiting driving and reducing smog levels. In the third article \"carfree day is spinning into a iig hit in Bogota\", iy Andrew Selsky, it descriies the annual carfree day they have to reduce smog. \" the goal is to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog\". So all over the world people are relizing that without cars, we are insuring the safety and well ieing of our environment.\\n\\nThe second advantage that would come with limiting car use is less stress. Everyone knows that driving a car causes emence amounts of stress. Getting caught in traffic is a major cause of stress in someones life. having to repeating wash your car just to get it dirt again causes stress. Having people in the iack of your car screaming and yelling all while music is ilasting, causes stress. So oiviously driving causes stress. If we were to limit our car usage we would not ie as stressed as we usually are. There would ie no traffic, no car washes and no one screaming in a small confineded space. In the first article \" In German Suiuri, life goes on without cars\", iy Elisaieth Rosenthal, a citizen named humdrum Walter, states \" When i had a car i was always tense. I'm much happier this way\". So with out the stress of a car humdrum Walter is a looser and happier person, less stress equals happier person. In the third article, \" Carfree dai is spinning into a iig hit in Bogota\", iy Andrew Selsky, it states \" It's a good opportunity to take away stress...\". If we have the opportunity to take away stress, why not take it. It is a huge advantage in our lives to limit driving if it takes away stress. No one wants stress, no one needs stress, and if we have an opportunity to take some of the stress away, take that opportunity.\\n\\nIn conclusion, there are many advantages to limiting car use, one ieing theat we get to help the environment and two ieing that it helps reduce stress. Our environment is already screwed up in so many ways, if we can help it to iecome the healthy environment it once was, then do it. Stress is proven to impare your personal health, no one wants to ie unhealthy and no one wants stress in their life. If you want the environment to get ietter and you want to reduce stress in your life then take this advantage and impliment it. Some might not think that this is an advantage, iut i just explained that it is a clear advantege that has ieen proved to help the enviornment and reduce stress.

Cars have been around since they became famous in the 1900s, when Henry Ford created and built the first ModelT. Cars have played a major role in our every day lives since then. But now, people are starting to question if limiting car usage would be a good thing. To me, limiting the use of cars might be a good thing to do.\\n\\nIn like matter of this, article, \"In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars,\" by Elizabeth Rosenthal states, how automobiles are the linchpin of suburbs, where middle class families from either Shanghai or Chicago tend to make their homes. Experts say how this is a huge impediment to current efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from tailpipe. Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe...and up to 50 percent in some carintensive areas in the United States. Cars are the main reason for the greenhouse gas emissions because of a lot of people driving them around all the time getting where they need to go. Article, \"Paris bans driving due to smog,\" by Robert Duffer says, how Paris, after days of nearrecord pollution, enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city. It also says, how on Monday, motorist with evennumbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at home or be fined a 22euro fine 31. The same order would be applied to oddnumbered plates the following day. Cars are the reason for polluting entire cities like Paris. This shows how bad cars can be because, of all the pollution that they can cause to an entire city.\\n\\nLikewise, in the article, \"Carfree day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota,\" by Andrew Selsky says, how programs that's set to spread to other countries, millions of Columbians hiked, biked, skated, or took the bus to work during a carfree day, leaving streets of this capital city eerily devoid of traffic jams. It was the third straight year cars have been banned with only buses and taxis permitted for the Day Without Cars in the capital city of 7 million. People like the idea of having carfree days because, it allows them to lesson the pollution that cars put out of their exhaust from people driving all the time. The article also tells how parks and sports centers have bustled throughout the city uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks rushhour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic and new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up. Having no cars has been good for the country of Columbia because, it has aloud them to repair things that have needed repairs for a long time, traffic jams have gone down, and restaurants and shopping districts have popped up, all due to the fact of having less cars around.\\n\\nIn conclusion, the use of less cars and having carfree days, have had a big impact on the environment of cities because, it is cutting down the air pollution that the cars have majorly polluted, it has aloud countries like Columbia to repair sidewalks, and cut down traffic jams. Limiting the use of cars would be a good thing for America. So we should limit the use of cars by maybe riding a bike, or maybe walking somewhere that isn't that far from you and doesn't need the use of a car to get you there. To me, limiting the use of cars might be a good thing to do.</td>\n","      <td>0</td>\n","      <td>0</td>\n","      <td>Kaggle</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>1</th>\n","      <td>Transportation is a large necessity in most countries worldwide. With no doubt, cars, buses, and other means of transportation make going from place to place easier and faster. However there's always a negative pollution. Although mobile transportation are a huge part of daily lives, we are endangering the Earth with harmful greenhouse gases, which could be suppressed.\\n\\nA small suburb community in Germany called Vauban, has started a \"carfree\" lifestyle. In this city, markets and stores are placed nearby homes, instead of being located by farend highways. Although Vauban is not completely carfree, 70% of Vauban families do not own cars Even a large 57% of families stated to have sold their cars to move to Vauban. Some families have even said to be less stressed depending on car transportation. Cars are responsible for about 12% of greenhouse gases, and can even be up to 50% in some carintensive areas in the United States.\\n\\nAnother insight to reduced car zones brings Paris' incident with smog. Paris' officials created a system that would in fact lower smog rates. On Monday, the motorists with evennumbered license plates numbers would be ordered to leave their cars at home, or they would suffer a fine. Same rule would occur on Tuesday, except motorists with oddnumbered license plates were targeted with fines. Congestion, or traffic, was reduced by 60% after five days of intense smog. Diesel fuel played a huge part in this pollution, having the fact that 67% of vehicles in France are of Diesel fuel. The impact of the clearing of smog, resided in banning the Tuesday rule of odd license plates.\\n\\nCould you imagine a day without seeing a single car being used? This phenomenon occurs once a year in Bogota, Colombia. With the exception of buses and taxis being used, cars are to be left unattended for an entire day. Having a carfree day just once a year can even reduce the pollution slightly. The day without cars is part of a campaign that originated in Bogota in the mid 1990s. This campaign has renewed and constructed numerous bicycle paths and sidewalks all over the city. Parks and sports centers have also sprung from this campaign. Devoting your time to a carfree lifestyle has it's hassles, but in hindsight, it has it's benefits.\\n\\nTo conclude, living a carfree lifestyle does not seem like a possibility in this day and age, however managing the use of cars and pollution is something every country should take time investing in. Think about how much of an impact it would be if everywhere worldwide would take part in airpollution reduction. Mobile transportation is lifestyle in a sense, and being dependent on cars or other means of transportation can impact the health of the Earth and even ourselves.</td>\n","      <td>0</td>\n","      <td>0</td>\n","      <td>Kaggle</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>2</th>\n","      <td>\"America's love affair with it's vehicles seems to be cooling\" says Elisabeth rosenthal. To understand rosenthal's perspective, it is easier to suggest that America's car usage is decreasing slowly. This isn't necessarily bad in the sense that it has certain positive effects. The advantages of limiting car usage includes an increase in security and health, along with a decrease in pollution and dependence.\\n\\nFirstly, when car usage is limited security and health is more likely to be guaranteed. The feeling of being secure is highly important to individuals everywhere. For example, many people in colombia used public transportation during a car free day \"leaving the streets of this capital city \", according to Andrew Selsky, \"eerily devoid of traffic jams\". The complications that stem from traffic jams end with a feeling of confidence. The plan to get from point A to B was more simple just a second ago. This complication in your personal plans leads you to become stressed as a feeling of doubt overcomes all thoughts. If car usage was limited, there would be a control on how much traffic accumulates thus minimizing chance of stress. As Heidrun Walter states \"when i had a car i was always tense. I'm much happier this way\". not only does car usage minimize conditions detrimental to health, it also enlarges your capacity for exercise. The main purpose of the car is to get someone from one place to another. when an important job takes over your personal life, it becomes difficult to do things most enjoyed in life. limits on car usage forces you to stay in shape. According to Andrew Selsky \"parks and sports centers also have bloomed throughout the city\". Less cars means healthier and natural situations. With parks and sport centers becoming more efficient, it becomes easier to find a more physically active population. Overall, less usage on cars minimizes stress and increases health.\\n\\nSecondly, limting car usage becomes beneficial to the environment. Now a days people have become annoyed with others who care so passionately about the environment. If you look behind their constant cries for action, there are solid facts. Yespollution is bad for the environment. Yes a bad envorment means unhealthy living. Yes cars are one of the main contributors to pollution in the environment. A pattern of less car usage, as Elisabeth Rosenthal states \"will have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the environment\". The less use of cars, the less pollution in the environment. One must observe limiting car usage as an opportunity to create a cleaner world and better future. The effects of pollution in the environment is completley dangerous and we, the car users, are to blame.\\n\\nAdditionally, it would lower the dependence on cars. Many people today find that their car is so useful. While it has many features and is a form of transportation, many do not figure what they would do if they did not have such a possesion. The development of people and their interaction with technology has left a wide gap between historic, natural ways and what is thought of as modern society. Being dependent is not always good for individuals. As david goldberg says \"all our development since world war II has been centered on the car, and that will have to change\". Many people could disagree and wonder why it is necessary to change our ways especially if we are so highly devloped. If being developed means being dependent on a harmful machine, then it could not be effective devlopment. According to Elisabeth Rosenthal \"cashstrapped americans could not afford new cars, and the unemployed were't going to work anyway\". Many people can't have the precious luxury of private transportation in the first place. Those who have had it have become distant to a more natural society. Peope have become so use to having cars that they have become oblivious to the significant effects. With limits on car usage , these effcts could be controlled.\\n\\nTo conclude, the advantages of limiting car usage is an increase in health, along with a decrease in pollution, and less dependence on cars. limiting car usage is a positive way to enfore an organized and clean environment, and ensure health and security of those who live in it. This is one reason America can be reffered to as a succesful country. It is not that America has decreased use of vehicles, but the fact that they have done what is best for majority.</td>\n","      <td>0</td>\n","      <td>0</td>\n","      <td>Kaggle</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>3</th>\n","      <td>How often do you ride in a car? Do you drive a one or any other motor vehicle to work? The store? To the mall? Have you ever thought about how many people in the world do that exact same thing travel to every destination using a fuel powered motorvehicle. Not many people realize the intensive damage that they're doing when they turn their key in the ignition. What if you didn't drive to work today? If you're like any regular car user, the thought \"What?! I could never survive without my car!\" may run through your mind. It is possible though, to live without your main mean of transport. Just look at cities like cuban, Paris, and Bogota each one has in some way restricted their people's usage of cars and they actually enjoy it! If you limit your car usage, it can intern result in many advantages and benefits in yourself and in your community.\\n\\nA not so recognized benefit to giving up your car usage would be the positive consequences it has on your health. In source 1, Heidrun Walter states that \"When he had a car, he was always tense. He's much happier without it.\" Think about it, imagine all the angry road rage you experience while driving. That surely does not have a positive effect on your mood or health. Driving takes a copious amount of focus and mental activity, such as, trying to navigate, dealing with bad drivers, etc., that after a short period of time, you're stressed out and tired. In cities like New York and Paris, the population is high. This leads to congestion in the streets and excessive amounts of pollution. Warm layers of air, according to Robert Duffer in \"Paris bans driving due to smog,\" traps the car emissions. How is that healthy? He also states that Paris had to enforce a temporary driving ban after the pollution levels reached an all time record. After a few days of less driving the pollution went way down. Since people aren't driving, they have to find other means of transport. This could include walking, biking, or skating to destinations. Those are all physical excercises! Your body is getting to work out and you'll mentally feel fresher more than you would sitting in a car.\\n\\nTaking a break from driving also can help with the overall look of your city. Pollution doesn't cause the flowers to grow. It certainly doesn't smell nice. It sets a filter over the town and gives off a \"dirty\" vibe. With less driving, there is less nasty pollution being emitted, therefore leading to a cleaner community. In Elisabeth Rosenthal's article, \"In German Suburb, Life goes on Without Cars,\" she gives the good point that since there is a restriction on car and motor vehicle transportation, there is going to be more walkers. If you have tons of people taking the sidewalks instead of the roads, you might need a few more pathways and closer stores that are in walking distance. Andrew Selsky states that \"Parks and sports centers have bloomed throughout the city uneven pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks... and new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up.\" As stated previously, pollution is not benefiting the environment. Organizations such as the Envronmental Protection Agency in the U.S., are promoting \"car reduced\" communities, says Rosenthal. These communities have far less pollution and are much cleaner. Cities are also promoting this idea and are having days devoted to \"nocar driving.\" In Bogota, Colombia, they hold an anual \"carfree\" day where only buses and taxis are permitted. Any other drivers would be fined. Although fining someone for using a posession they own might ruffle some feathers, it did have a successful turn out and significantly reduced the \"smog.\" In conclusion, although the idea of giving up our precious automobiles for walking to our destination might sound impossible, it's not. Reducing our driving can lead to many benefits and advantages in our daily lives. These include an increase in health, an improved look to our cities, and an improved environment all around us.</td>\n","      <td>0</td>\n","      <td>0</td>\n","      <td>Kaggle</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>4</th>\n","      <td>Cars are a wonderful thing. They are perhaps one of the worlds greatest advancements and technologies. Cars get us from point a to point i. That is exactly what we want isnt it? We as humans want to get from one place to anther as fast as possiile. Cars are a suitaile to do that. They get us across the city in a matter of minutes. Much faster than anyhting else we have. A train isnt going to get me across the city as fast as my car is and neither is a puilic ius, iut those other forms of transportation just might ie the way to go. Don't get me wrong, cars are an aisolutly amazing thing iut, mayie they just cause way to much stress, and mayie they hurt our environment in ways that we don't think they will. With a ius or a train you do not have to worry aiout washing your car or getting frustrated when stuck in a iad traffic jam on I4. Also there is not as much pollution in air hurting our environment. You might not think so, iut there are many advantages to limiting our car usage.\\n\\nOne advantage that not only humans would ienefit from, iut also plants and animals is that there would ie a lot less pollution in the air hurting out environment. Right now our cars give off gases that are extremely harmful towards our environment. These gases are called green house gases and come out of the exhaust pipes in our cars. Your car alone docent give off much gas iut collectively, our cars give off enormous amounts of gases. This is especially true in iig cities like France. In France, their pollution level was so high it was record ireaking. due to that france decided to enforce a partial ian on cars. This is descriied in the second article \" Paris ians driving due to smog\", iy Roiert Duffer, \" On Monday motorists with evennumiered license plates were orderd to leave their cars at home or suffer a 22euro fine 31. The same would apply to oddnumiered plates the following day.\" After France limited driving there congestion was down iy 60 percent. \" Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France\". So after five days of intense smog, 60 percent of it was clear after not using cars for only a little while. Even across the world in Bogota, columiia they are limiting driving and reducing smog levels. In the third article \"carfree day is spinning into a iig hit in Bogota\", iy Andrew Selsky, it descriies the annual carfree day they have to reduce smog. \" the goal is to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog\". So all over the world people are relizing that without cars, we are insuring the safety and well ieing of our environment.\\n\\nThe second advantage that would come with limiting car use is less stress. Everyone knows that driving a car causes emence amounts of stress. Getting caught in traffic is a major cause of stress in someones life. having to repeating wash your car just to get it dirt again causes stress. Having people in the iack of your car screaming and yelling all while music is ilasting, causes stress. So oiviously driving causes stress. If we were to limit our car usage we would not ie as stressed as we usually are. There would ie no traffic, no car washes and no one screaming in a small confineded space. In the first article \" In German Suiuri, life goes on without cars\", iy Elisaieth Rosenthal, a citizen named humdrum Walter, states \" When i had a car i was always tense. I'm much happier this way\". So with out the stress of a car humdrum Walter is a looser and happier person, less stress equals happier person. In the third article, \" Carfree dai is spinning into a iig hit in Bogota\", iy Andrew Selsky, it states \" It's a good opportunity to take away stress...\". If we have the opportunity to take away stress, why not take it. It is a huge advantage in our lives to limit driving if it takes away stress. No one wants stress, no one needs stress, and if we have an opportunity to take some of the stress away, take that opportunity.\\n\\nIn conclusion, there are many advantages to limiting car use, one ieing theat we get to help the environment and two ieing that it helps reduce stress. Our environment is already screwed up in so many ways, if we can help it to iecome the healthy environment it once was, then do it. Stress is proven to impare your personal health, no one wants to ie unhealthy and no one wants stress in their life. If you want the environment to get ietter and you want to reduce stress in your life then take this advantage and impliment it.

Some people are really excited about this change, thinking that driverless cars will make our roads safer and our lives easier. But other people are worried about the implications of driverless cars, and whether they will really be as safe as we hope.\\n\\nIm on the side of the fence that is excited about driverless cars. I think they have the potential to make our roads much safer, and to change the way we live our lives. I think its important to look at both the pros and the cons of this new technology, but in the end, I think the pros outweigh the cons.\\n\\nOne of the biggest pros of driverless cars is that they could potentially make our roads much safer. Driverless cars are able to communicate with each other, and they can brake or swerve to avoid accidents. This means that they are much less likely to get into accidents than human drivers. In fact, a study by Google found that their driverless cars were involved in only one accident in over 1 million miles of driving. Thats a pretty impressive safety record.\\n\\nDriverless cars could also change the way we live our lives. For example, they could allow us to work while were driving. This would be a huge time-saver, and it would allow us to get more done while were on the go. Driverless cars could also allow us to spend more time with our families. We could use the time we used to spend driving to talk to our kids, or to listen to music or a podcast.\\n\\nThere are also some cons to driverless cars. For example, some people worry that they will be unsafe. They think that there will be accidents and injuries caused by driverless cars, and that they will be less reliable than human drivers. They also think that driverless cars will put a lot of people out of work, since so many jobs involve driving.\\n\\nIn the end, I think the pros of driverless cars outweigh the cons. I think they are going to change the way we live our lives, and make our roads much safer. I think its important to be aware of the cons, but I think we should embrace this new technology and see what it can do for us.\",\n          \"Dear Senator,\\n\\nI am writing to you today to express my strong support for abolishing the Electoral College. The Electoral College is an outdated and undemocratic system that has no place in our 21st century democracy.\\n\\nThe Electoral College was created in the 18th century as a compromise between the large states and the small states. The large states wanted the president to be elected by popular vote, while the small states wanted each state to have an equal number of votes. The Electoral College was a way to satisfy both groups.\\n\\nHowever, the Electoral College is no longer necessary. The United States is no longer a collection of small, independent states. It is a unified nation with a strong central government. In a nation as large and diverse as the United States, it is only fair that the president be elected by the people.\\n\\nThe Electoral College is also undemocratic. It is possible for a candidate to win the popular vote but lose the election. This has happened five times in American history, most recently in 2016. In that election, Hillary Clinton won the popular vote by more than 3 million votes, but Donald Trump won the Electoral College and became president.\\n\\nThe Electoral College also gives more power to the small states than they deserve. In a state with a small population, each vote counts more than it does in a state with a large population. This means that people in small states have more of a say in who becomes president than people in large states.\\n\\nI urge you to support a constitutional amendment that would abolish the Electoral College and elect the president by popular vote. This is the only way to ensure that every vote counts and that we have a truly democratic election.\\n\\nThank you for your time and consideration.\\n\\nSincerely,\",\n          \"Back in the day they did'nt have technology.

Cars have been around since they became famous in the 1900s, when Henry Ford created and built the first ModelT. Cars have played a major role in our every day lives since then. But now, people are starting to question if limiting car usage would be a good thing. To me, limiting the use of cars might be a good thing to do.\\n\\nIn like matter of this, article, \"In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars,\" by Elizabeth Rosenthal states, how automobiles are the linchpin of suburbs, where middle class families from either Shanghai or Chicago tend to make their homes. Experts say how this is a huge impediment to current efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from tailpipe. Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe...and up to 50 percent in some carintensive areas in the United States. Cars are the main reason for the greenhouse gas emissions because of a lot of people driving them around all the time getting where they need to go. Article, \"Paris bans driving due to smog,\" by Robert Duffer says, how Paris, after days of nearrecord pollution, enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city. It also says, how on Monday, motorist with evennumbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at home or be fined a 22euro fine 31. The same order would be applied to oddnumbered plates the following day. Cars are the reason for polluting entire cities like Paris. This shows how bad cars can be because, of all the pollution that they can cause to an entire city.\\n\\nLikewise, in the article, \"Carfree day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota,\" by Andrew Selsky says, how programs that's set to spread to other countries, millions of Columbians hiked, biked, skated, or took the bus to work during a carfree day, leaving streets of this capital city eerily devoid of traffic jams. It was the third straight year cars have been banned with only buses and taxis permitted for the Day Without Cars in the capital city of 7 million. People like the idea of having carfree days because, it allows them to lesson the pollution that cars put out of their exhaust from people driving all the time. The article also tells how parks and sports centers have bustled throughout the city uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks rushhour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic and new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up. Having no cars has been good for the country of Columbia because, it has aloud them to repair things that have needed repairs for a long time, traffic jams have gone down, and restaurants and shopping districts have popped up, all due to the fact of having less cars around.\\n\\nIn conclusion, the use of less cars and having carfree days, have had a big impact on the environment of cities because, it is cutting down the air pollution that the cars have majorly polluted, it has aloud countries like Columbia to repair sidewalks, and cut down traffic jams. Limiting the use of cars would be a good thing for America. So we should limit the use of cars by maybe riding a bike, or maybe walking somewhere that isn't that far from you and doesn't need the use of a car to get you there. To me, limiting the use of cars might be a good thing to do.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    \n","1      Transportation is a large necessity in most countries worldwide. With no doubt, cars, buses, and other means of transportation make going from place to place easier and faster. However there's always a negative pollution. Although mobile transportation are a huge part of daily lives, we are endangering the Earth with harmful greenhouse gases, which could be suppressed.\\n\\nA small suburb community in Germany called Vauban, has started a \"carfree\" lifestyle. In this city, markets and stores are placed nearby homes, instead of being located by farend highways. Although Vauban is not completely carfree, 70% of Vauban families do not own cars Even a large 57% of families stated to have sold their cars to move to Vauban. Some families have even said to be less stressed depending on car transportation. Cars are responsible for about 12% of greenhouse gases, and can even be up to 50% in some carintensive areas in the United States.\\n\\nAnother insight to reduced car zones brings Paris' incident with smog. Paris' officials created a system that would in fact lower smog rates. On Monday, the motorists with evennumbered license plates numbers would be ordered to leave their cars at home, or they would suffer a fine. Same rule would occur on Tuesday, except motorists with oddnumbered license plates were targeted with fines. Congestion, or traffic, was reduced by 60% after five days of intense smog. Diesel fuel played a huge part in this pollution, having the fact that 67% of vehicles in France are of Diesel fuel. The impact of the clearing of smog, resided in banning the Tuesday rule of odd license plates.\\n\\nCould you imagine a day without seeing a single car being used? This phenomenon occurs once a year in Bogota, Colombia. With the exception of buses and taxis being used, cars are to be left unattended for an entire day. Having a carfree day just once a year can even reduce the pollution slightly. The day without cars is part of a campaign that originated in Bogota in the mid 1990s. This campaign has renewed and constructed numerous bicycle paths and sidewalks all over the city. Parks and sports centers have also sprung from this campaign. Devoting your time to a carfree lifestyle has it's hassles, but in hindsight, it has it's benefits.\\n\\nTo conclude, living a carfree lifestyle does not seem like a possibility in this day and age, however managing the use of cars and pollution is something every country should take time investing in. Think about how much of an impact it would be if everywhere worldwide would take part in airpollution reduction. Mobile transportation is lifestyle in a sense, and being dependent on cars or other means of transportation can impact the health of the Earth and even ourselves.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n","2      \"America's love affair with it's vehicles seems to be cooling\" says Elisabeth rosenthal. To understand rosenthal's perspective, it is easier to suggest that America's car usage is decreasing slowly. This isn't necessarily bad in the sense that it has certain positive effects. The advantages of limiting car usage includes an increase in security and health, along with a decrease in pollution and dependence.\\n\\nFirstly, when car usage is limited security and health is more likely to be guaranteed. The feeling of being secure is highly important to individuals everywhere. For example, many people in colombia used public transportation during a car free day \"leaving the streets of this capital city \", according to Andrew Selsky, \"eerily devoid of traffic jams\". The complications that stem from traffic jams end with a feeling of confidence. The plan to get from point A to B was more simple just a second ago. This complication in your personal plans leads you to become stressed as a feeling of doubt overcomes all thoughts. If car usage was limited, there would be a control on how much traffic accumulates thus minimizing chance of stress. As Heidrun Walter states \"when i had a car i was always tense. I'm much happier this way\". not only does car usage minimize conditions detrimental to health, it also enlarges your capacity for exercise. The main purpose of the car is to get someone from one place to another. when an important job takes over your personal life, it becomes difficult to do things most enjoyed in life. limits on car usage forces you to stay in shape. According to Andrew Selsky \"parks and sports centers also have bloomed throughout the city\". Less cars means healthier and natural situations. With parks and sport centers becoming more efficient, it becomes easier to find a more physically active population. Overall, less usage on cars minimizes stress and increases health.\\n\\nSecondly, limting car usage becomes beneficial to the environment. Now a days people have become annoyed with others who care so passionately about the environment. If you look behind their constant cries for action, there are solid facts. Yespollution is bad for the environment. Yes a bad envorment means unhealthy living. Yes cars are one of the main contributors to pollution in the environment. A pattern of less car usage, as Elisabeth Rosenthal states \"will have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the environment\". The less use of cars, the less pollution in the environment. One must observe limiting car usage as an opportunity to create a cleaner world and better future. The effects of pollution in the environment is completley dangerous and we, the car users, are to blame.\\n\\nAdditionally, it would lower the dependence on cars. Many people today find that their car is so useful. While it has many features and is a form of transportation, many do not figure what they would do if they did not have such a possesion. The development of people and their interaction with technology has left a wide gap between historic, natural ways and what is thought of as modern society. Being dependent is not always good for individuals. As david goldberg says \"all our development since world war II has been centered on the car, and that will have to change\". Many people could disagree and wonder why it is necessary to change our ways especially if we are so highly devloped. If being developed means being dependent on a harmful machine, then it could not be effective devlopment. According to Elisabeth Rosenthal \"cashstrapped americans could not afford new cars, and the unemployed were't going to work anyway\". Many people can't have the precious luxury of private transportation in the first place. Those who have had it have become distant to a more natural society. Peope have become so use to having cars that they have become oblivious to the significant effects. With limits on car usage , these effcts could be controlled.\\n\\nTo conclude, the advantages of limiting car usage is an increase in health, along with a decrease in pollution, and less dependence on cars. limiting car usage is a positive way to enfore an organized and clean environment, and ensure health and security of those who live in it. This is one reason America can be reffered to as a succesful country. It is not that America has decreased use of vehicles, but the fact that they have done what is best for majority.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               \n","3      How often do you ride in a car? Do you drive a one or any other motor vehicle to work? The store? To the mall? Have you ever thought about how many people in the world do that exact same thing travel to every destination using a fuel powered motorvehicle. Not many people realize the intensive damage that they're doing when they turn their key in the ignition. What if you didn't drive to work today? If you're like any regular car user, the thought \"What?! I could never survive without my car!\" may run through your mind. It is possible though, to live without your main mean of transport. Just look at cities like cuban, Paris, and Bogota each one has in some way restricted their people's usage of cars and they actually enjoy it! If you limit your car usage, it can intern result in many advantages and benefits in yourself and in your community.\\n\\nA not so recognized benefit to giving up your car usage would be the positive consequences it has on your health. In source 1, Heidrun Walter states that \"When he had a car, he was always tense. He's much happier without it.\" Think about it, imagine all the angry road rage you experience while driving. That surely does not have a positive effect on your mood or health. Driving takes a copious amount of focus and mental activity, such as, trying to navigate, dealing with bad drivers, etc., that after a short period of time, you're stressed out and tired. In cities like New York and Paris, the population is high. This leads to congestion in the streets and excessive amounts of pollution. Warm layers of air, according to Robert Duffer in \"Paris bans driving due to smog,\" traps the car emissions. How is that healthy? He also states that Paris had to enforce a temporary driving ban after the pollution levels reached an all time record. After a few days of less driving the pollution went way down. Since people aren't driving, they have to find other means of transport. This could include walking, biking, or skating to destinations. Those are all physical excercises! Your body is getting to work out and you'll mentally feel fresher more than you would sitting in a car.\\n\\nTaking a break from driving also can help with the overall look of your city. Pollution doesn't cause the flowers to grow. It certainly doesn't smell nice. It sets a filter over the town and gives off a \"dirty\" vibe. With less driving, there is less nasty pollution being emitted, therefore leading to a cleaner community. In Elisabeth Rosenthal's article, \"In German Suburb, Life goes on Without Cars,\" she gives the good point that since there is a restriction on car and motor vehicle transportation, there is going to be more walkers. If you have tons of people taking the sidewalks instead of the roads, you might need a few more pathways and closer stores that are in walking distance. Andrew Selsky states that \"Parks and sports centers have bloomed throughout the city uneven pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks... and new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up.\" As stated previously, pollution is not benefiting the environment. Organizations such as the Envronmental Protection Agency in the U.S., are promoting \"car reduced\" communities, says Rosenthal. These communities have far less pollution and are much cleaner. Cities are also promoting this idea and are having days devoted to \"nocar driving.\" In Bogota, Colombia, they hold an anual \"carfree\" day where only buses and taxis are permitted. Any other drivers would be fined. Although fining someone for using a posession they own might ruffle some feathers, it did have a successful turn out and significantly reduced the \"smog.\" In conclusion, although the idea of giving up our precious automobiles for walking to our destination might sound impossible, it's not. Reducing our driving can lead to many benefits and advantages in our daily lives. These include an increase in health, an improved look to our cities, and an improved environment all around us.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  \n","4      Cars are a wonderful thing. They are perhaps one of the worlds greatest advancements and technologies. Cars get us from point a to point i. That is exactly what we want isnt it? We as humans want to get from one place to anther as fast as possiile. Cars are a suitaile to do that. They get us across the city in a matter of minutes. Much faster than anyhting else we have. A train isnt going to get me across the city as fast as my car is and neither is a puilic ius, iut those other forms of transportation just might ie the way to go. Don't get me wrong, cars are an aisolutly amazing thing iut, mayie they just cause way to much stress, and mayie they hurt our environment in ways that we don't think they will. With a ius or a train you do not have to worry aiout washing your car or getting frustrated when stuck in a iad traffic jam on I4. Also there is not as much pollution in air hurting our environment. You might not think so, iut there are many advantages to limiting our car usage.\\n\\nOne advantage that not only humans would ienefit from, iut also plants and animals is that there would ie a lot less pollution in the air hurting out environment. Right now our cars give off gases that are extremely harmful towards our environment. These gases are called green house gases and come out of the exhaust pipes in our cars. Your car alone docent give off much gas iut collectively, our cars give off enormous amounts of gases. This is especially true in iig cities like France. In France, their pollution level was so high it was record ireaking. due to that france decided to enforce a partial ian on cars. This is descriied in the second article \" Paris ians driving due to smog\", iy Roiert Duffer, \" On Monday motorists with evennumiered license plates were orderd to leave their cars at home or suffer a 22euro fine 31. The same would apply to oddnumiered plates the following day.\" After France limited driving there congestion was down iy 60 percent. \" Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France\". So after five days of intense smog, 60 percent of it was clear after not using cars for only a little while. Even across the world in Bogota, columiia they are limiting driving and reducing smog levels. In the third article \"carfree day is spinning into a iig hit in Bogota\", iy Andrew Selsky, it descriies the annual carfree day they have to reduce smog. \" the goal is to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog\". So all over the world people are relizing that without cars, we are insuring the safety and well ieing of our environment.\\n\\nThe second advantage that would come with limiting car use is less stress. Everyone knows that driving a car causes emence amounts of stress. Getting caught in traffic is a major cause of stress in someones life. having to repeating wash your car just to get it dirt again causes stress. Having people in the iack of your car screaming and yelling all while music is ilasting, causes stress. So oiviously driving causes stress. If we were to limit our car usage we would not ie as stressed as we usually are. There would ie no traffic, no car washes and no one screaming in a small confineded space. In the first article \" In German Suiuri, life goes on without cars\", iy Elisaieth Rosenthal, a citizen named humdrum Walter, states \" When i had a car i was always tense. I'm much happier this way\". So with out the stress of a car humdrum Walter is a looser and happier person, less stress equals happier person. In the third article, \" Carfree dai is spinning into a iig hit in Bogota\", iy Andrew Selsky, it states \" It's a good opportunity to take away stress...\". If we have the opportunity to take away stress, why not take it. It is a huge advantage in our lives to limit driving if it takes away stress. No one wants stress, no one needs stress, and if we have an opportunity to take some of the stress away, take that opportunity.\\n\\nIn conclusion, there are many advantages to limiting car use, one ieing theat we get to help the environment and two ieing that it helps reduce stress. Our environment is already screwed up in so many ways, if we can help it to iecome the healthy environment it once was, then do it. Stress is proven to impare your personal health, no one wants to ie unhealthy and no one wants stress in their life. If you want the environment to get ietter and you want to reduce stress in your life then take this advantage and impliment it.

Cars have been around since they became famous in the 1900s, when Henry Ford created and built the first ModelT. Cars have played a major role in our every day lives since then. But now, people are starting to question if limiting car usage would be a good thing. To me, limiting the use of cars might be a good thing to do.\\n\\nIn like matter of this, article, \"In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars,\" by Elizabeth Rosenthal states, how automobiles are the linchpin of suburbs, where middle class families from either Shanghai or Chicago tend to make their homes. Experts say how this is a huge impediment to current efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from tailpipe. Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe...and up to 50 percent in some carintensive areas in the United States. Cars are the main reason for the greenhouse gas emissions because of a lot of people driving them around all the time getting where they need to go. Article, \"Paris bans driving due to smog,\" by Robert Duffer says, how Paris, after days of nearrecord pollution, enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city. It also says, how on Monday, motorist with evennumbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at home or be fined a 22euro fine 31. The same order would be applied to oddnumbered plates the following day. Cars are the reason for polluting entire cities like Paris. This shows how bad cars can be because, of all the pollution that they can cause to an entire city.\\n\\nLikewise, in the article, \"Carfree day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota,\" by Andrew Selsky says, how programs that's set to spread to other countries, millions of Columbians hiked, biked, skated, or took the bus to work during a carfree day, leaving streets of this capital city eerily devoid of traffic jams. It was the third straight year cars have been banned with only buses and taxis permitted for the Day Without Cars in the capital city of 7 million. People like the idea of having carfree days because, it allows them to lesson the pollution that cars put out of their exhaust from people driving all the time. The article also tells how parks and sports centers have bustled throughout the city uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks rushhour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic and new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up. Having no cars has been good for the country of Columbia because, it has aloud them to repair things that have needed repairs for a long time, traffic jams have gone down, and restaurants and shopping districts have popped up, all due to the fact of having less cars around.\\n\\nIn conclusion, the use of less cars and having carfree days, have had a big impact on the environment of cities because, it is cutting down the air pollution that the cars have majorly polluted, it has aloud countries like Columbia to repair sidewalks, and cut down traffic jams. Limiting the use of cars would be a good thing for America. So we should limit the use of cars by maybe riding a bike, or maybe walking somewhere that isn't that far from you and doesn't need the use of a car to get you there. To me, limiting the use of cars might be a good thing to do.</td>\n","      <td>0</td>\n","      <td>0</td>\n","      <td>Kaggle</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>1</th>\n","      <td>Transportation is a large necessity in most countries worldwide. With no doubt, cars, buses, and other means of transportation make going from place to place easier and faster. However there's always a negative pollution. Although mobile transportation are a huge part of daily lives, we are endangering the Earth with harmful greenhouse gases, which could be suppressed.\\n\\nA small suburb community in Germany called Vauban, has started a \"carfree\" lifestyle. In this city, markets and stores are placed nearby homes, instead of being located by farend highways. Although Vauban is not completely carfree, 70% of Vauban families do not own cars Even a large 57% of families stated to have sold their cars to move to Vauban. Some families have even said to be less stressed depending on car transportation. Cars are responsible for about 12% of greenhouse gases, and can even be up to 50% in some carintensive areas in the United States.\\n\\nAnother insight to reduced car zones brings Paris' incident with smog. Paris' officials created a system that would in fact lower smog rates. On Monday, the motorists with evennumbered license plates numbers would be ordered to leave their cars at home, or they would suffer a fine. Same rule would occur on Tuesday, except motorists with oddnumbered license plates were targeted with fines. Congestion, or traffic, was reduced by 60% after five days of intense smog. Diesel fuel played a huge part in this pollution, having the fact that 67% of vehicles in France are of Diesel fuel. The impact of the clearing of smog, resided in banning the Tuesday rule of odd license plates.\\n\\nCould you imagine a day without seeing a single car being used? This phenomenon occurs once a year in Bogota, Colombia. With the exception of buses and taxis being used, cars are to be left unattended for an entire day. Having a carfree day just once a year can even reduce the pollution slightly. The day without cars is part of a campaign that originated in Bogota in the mid 1990s. This campaign has renewed and constructed numerous bicycle paths and sidewalks all over the city. Parks and sports centers have also sprung from this campaign. Devoting your time to a carfree lifestyle has it's hassles, but in hindsight, it has it's benefits.\\n\\nTo conclude, living a carfree lifestyle does not seem like a possibility in this day and age, however managing the use of cars and pollution is something every country should take time investing in. Think about how much of an impact it would be if everywhere worldwide would take part in airpollution reduction. Mobile transportation is lifestyle in a sense, and being dependent on cars or other means of transportation can impact the health of the Earth and even ourselves.</td>\n","      <td>0</td>\n","      <td>0</td>\n","      <td>Kaggle</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>2</th>\n","      <td>\"America's love affair with it's vehicles seems to be cooling\" says Elisabeth rosenthal. To understand rosenthal's perspective, it is easier to suggest that America's car usage is decreasing slowly. This isn't necessarily bad in the sense that it has certain positive effects. The advantages of limiting car usage includes an increase in security and health, along with a decrease in pollution and dependence.\\n\\nFirstly, when car usage is limited security and health is more likely to be guaranteed. The feeling of being secure is highly important to individuals everywhere. For example, many people in colombia used public transportation during a car free day \"leaving the streets of this capital city \", according to Andrew Selsky, \"eerily devoid of traffic jams\". The complications that stem from traffic jams end with a feeling of confidence. The plan to get from point A to B was more simple just a second ago. This complication in your personal plans leads you to become stressed as a feeling of doubt overcomes all thoughts. If car usage was limited, there would be a control on how much traffic accumulates thus minimizing chance of stress. As Heidrun Walter states \"when i had a car i was always tense. I'm much happier this way\". not only does car usage minimize conditions detrimental to health, it also enlarges your capacity for exercise. The main purpose of the car is to get someone from one place to another. when an important job takes over your personal life, it becomes difficult to do things most enjoyed in life. limits on car usage forces you to stay in shape. According to Andrew Selsky \"parks and sports centers also have bloomed throughout the city\". Less cars means healthier and natural situations. With parks and sport centers becoming more efficient, it becomes easier to find a more physically active population. Overall, less usage on cars minimizes stress and increases health.\\n\\nSecondly, limting car usage becomes beneficial to the environment. Now a days people have become annoyed with others who care so passionately about the environment. If you look behind their constant cries for action, there are solid facts. Yespollution is bad for the environment. Yes a bad envorment means unhealthy living. Yes cars are one of the main contributors to pollution in the environment. A pattern of less car usage, as Elisabeth Rosenthal states \"will have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the environment\". The less use of cars, the less pollution in the environment. One must observe limiting car usage as an opportunity to create a cleaner world and better future. The effects of pollution in the environment is completley dangerous and we, the car users, are to blame.\\n\\nAdditionally, it would lower the dependence on cars. Many people today find that their car is so useful. While it has many features and is a form of transportation, many do not figure what they would do if they did not have such a possesion. The development of people and their interaction with technology has left a wide gap between historic, natural ways and what is thought of as modern society. Being dependent is not always good for individuals. As david goldberg says \"all our development since world war II has been centered on the car, and that will have to change\". Many people could disagree and wonder why it is necessary to change our ways especially if we are so highly devloped. If being developed means being dependent on a harmful machine, then it could not be effective devlopment. According to Elisabeth Rosenthal \"cashstrapped americans could not afford new cars, and the unemployed were't going to work anyway\". Many people can't have the precious luxury of private transportation in the first place. Those who have had it have become distant to a more natural society. Peope have become so use to having cars that they have become oblivious to the significant effects. With limits on car usage , these effcts could be controlled.\\n\\nTo conclude, the advantages of limiting car usage is an increase in health, along with a decrease in pollution, and less dependence on cars. limiting car usage is a positive way to enfore an organized and clean environment, and ensure health and security of those who live in it. This is one reason America can be reffered to as a succesful country. It is not that America has decreased use of vehicles, but the fact that they have done what is best for majority.</td>\n","      <td>0</td>\n","      <td>0</td>\n","      <td>Kaggle</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>3</th>\n","      <td>How often do you ride in a car? Do you drive a one or any other motor vehicle to work? The store? To the mall? Have you ever thought about how many people in the world do that exact same thing travel to every destination using a fuel powered motorvehicle. Not many people realize the intensive damage that they're doing when they turn their key in the ignition. What if you didn't drive to work today? If you're like any regular car user, the thought \"What?! I could never survive without my car!\" may run through your mind. It is possible though, to live without your main mean of transport. Just look at cities like cuban, Paris, and Bogota each one has in some way restricted their people's usage of cars and they actually enjoy it! If you limit your car usage, it can intern result in many advantages and benefits in yourself and in your community.\\n\\nA not so recognized benefit to giving up your car usage would be the positive consequences it has on your health. In source 1, Heidrun Walter states that \"When he had a car, he was always tense. He's much happier without it.\" Think about it, imagine all the angry road rage you experience while driving. That surely does not have a positive effect on your mood or health. Driving takes a copious amount of focus and mental activity, such as, trying to navigate, dealing with bad drivers, etc., that after a short period of time, you're stressed out and tired. In cities like New York and Paris, the population is high. This leads to congestion in the streets and excessive amounts of pollution. Warm layers of air, according to Robert Duffer in \"Paris bans driving due to smog,\" traps the car emissions. How is that healthy? He also states that Paris had to enforce a temporary driving ban after the pollution levels reached an all time record. After a few days of less driving the pollution went way down. Since people aren't driving, they have to find other means of transport. This could include walking, biking, or skating to destinations. Those are all physical excercises! Your body is getting to work out and you'll mentally feel fresher more than you would sitting in a car.\\n\\nTaking a break from driving also can help with the overall look of your city. Pollution doesn't cause the flowers to grow. It certainly doesn't smell nice. It sets a filter over the town and gives off a \"dirty\" vibe. With less driving, there is less nasty pollution being emitted, therefore leading to a cleaner community. In Elisabeth Rosenthal's article, \"In German Suburb, Life goes on Without Cars,\" she gives the good point that since there is a restriction on car and motor vehicle transportation, there is going to be more walkers. If you have tons of people taking the sidewalks instead of the roads, you might need a few more pathways and closer stores that are in walking distance. Andrew Selsky states that \"Parks and sports centers have bloomed throughout the city uneven pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks... and new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up.\" As stated previously, pollution is not benefiting the environment. Organizations such as the Envronmental Protection Agency in the U.S., are promoting \"car reduced\" communities, says Rosenthal. These communities have far less pollution and are much cleaner. Cities are also promoting this idea and are having days devoted to \"nocar driving.\" In Bogota, Colombia, they hold an anual \"carfree\" day where only buses and taxis are permitted. Any other drivers would be fined. Although fining someone for using a posession they own might ruffle some feathers, it did have a successful turn out and significantly reduced the \"smog.\" In conclusion, although the idea of giving up our precious automobiles for walking to our destination might sound impossible, it's not. Reducing our driving can lead to many benefits and advantages in our daily lives. These include an increase in health, an improved look to our cities, and an improved environment all around us.</td>\n","      <td>0</td>\n","      <td>0</td>\n","      <td>Kaggle</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>4</th>\n","      <td>Cars are a wonderful thing. They are perhaps one of the worlds greatest advancements and technologies. Cars get us from point a to point i. That is exactly what we want isnt it? We as humans want to get from one place to anther as fast as possiile. Cars are a suitaile to do that. They get us across the city in a matter of minutes. Much faster than anyhting else we have. A train isnt going to get me across the city as fast as my car is and neither is a puilic ius, iut those other forms of transportation just might ie the way to go. Don't get me wrong, cars are an aisolutly amazing thing iut, mayie they just cause way to much stress, and mayie they hurt our environment in ways that we don't think they will. With a ius or a train you do not have to worry aiout washing your car or getting frustrated when stuck in a iad traffic jam on I4. Also there is not as much pollution in air hurting our environment. You might not think so, iut there are many advantages to limiting our car usage.\\n\\nOne advantage that not only humans would ienefit from, iut also plants and animals is that there would ie a lot less pollution in the air hurting out environment. Right now our cars give off gases that are extremely harmful towards our environment. These gases are called green house gases and come out of the exhaust pipes in our cars. Your car alone docent give off much gas iut collectively, our cars give off enormous amounts of gases. This is especially true in iig cities like France. In France, their pollution level was so high it was record ireaking. due to that france decided to enforce a partial ian on cars. This is descriied in the second article \" Paris ians driving due to smog\", iy Roiert Duffer, \" On Monday motorists with evennumiered license plates were orderd to leave their cars at home or suffer a 22euro fine 31. The same would apply to oddnumiered plates the following day.\" After France limited driving there congestion was down iy 60 percent. \" Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France\". So after five days of intense smog, 60 percent of it was clear after not using cars for only a little while. Even across the world in Bogota, columiia they are limiting driving and reducing smog levels. In the third article \"carfree day is spinning into a iig hit in Bogota\", iy Andrew Selsky, it descriies the annual carfree day they have to reduce smog. \" the goal is to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog\". So all over the world people are relizing that without cars, we are insuring the safety and well ieing of our environment.\\n\\nThe second advantage that would come with limiting car use is less stress. Everyone knows that driving a car causes emence amounts of stress. Getting caught in traffic is a major cause of stress in someones life. having to repeating wash your car just to get it dirt again causes stress. Having people in the iack of your car screaming and yelling all while music is ilasting, causes stress. So oiviously driving causes stress. If we were to limit our car usage we would not ie as stressed as we usually are. There would ie no traffic, no car washes and no one screaming in a small confineded space. In the first article \" In German Suiuri, life goes on without cars\", iy Elisaieth Rosenthal, a citizen named humdrum Walter, states \" When i had a car i was always tense. I'm much happier this way\". So with out the stress of a car humdrum Walter is a looser and happier person, less stress equals happier person. In the third article, \" Carfree dai is spinning into a iig hit in Bogota\", iy Andrew Selsky, it states \" It's a good opportunity to take away stress...\". If we have the opportunity to take away stress, why not take it. It is a huge advantage in our lives to limit driving if it takes away stress. No one wants stress, no one needs stress, and if we have an opportunity to take some of the stress away, take that opportunity.\\n\\nIn conclusion, there are many advantages to limiting car use, one ieing theat we get to help the environment and two ieing that it helps reduce stress. Our environment is already screwed up in so many ways, if we can help it to iecome the healthy environment it once was, then do it. Stress is proven to impare your personal health, no one wants to ie unhealthy and no one wants stress in their life. If you want the environment to get ietter and you want to reduce stress in your life then take this advantage and impliment it.

Some people are really excited about this change, thinking that driverless cars will make our roads safer and our lives easier. But other people are worried about the implications of driverless cars, and whether they will really be as safe as we hope.\\n\\nIm on the side of the fence that is excited about driverless cars. I think they have the potential to make our roads much safer, and to change the way we live our lives. I think its important to look at both the pros and the cons of this new technology, but in the end, I think the pros outweigh the cons.\\n\\nOne of the biggest pros of driverless cars is that they could potentially make our roads much safer. Driverless cars are able to communicate with each other, and they can brake or swerve to avoid accidents. This means that they are much less likely to get into accidents than human drivers. In fact, a study by Google found that their driverless cars were involved in only one accident in over 1 million miles of driving. Thats a pretty impressive safety record.\\n\\nDriverless cars could also change the way we live our lives. For example, they could allow us to work while were driving. This would be a huge time-saver, and it would allow us to get more done while were on the go. Driverless cars could also allow us to spend more time with our families. We could use the time we used to spend driving to talk to our kids, or to listen to music or a podcast.\\n\\nThere are also some cons to driverless cars. For example, some people worry that they will be unsafe. They think that there will be accidents and injuries caused by driverless cars, and that they will be less reliable than human drivers. They also think that driverless cars will put a lot of people out of work, since so many jobs involve driving.\\n\\nIn the end, I think the pros of driverless cars outweigh the cons. I think they are going to change the way we live our lives, and make our roads much safer. I think its important to be aware of the cons, but I think we should embrace this new technology and see what it can do for us.\",\n          \"Dear Senator,\\n\\nI am writing to you today to express my strong support for abolishing the Electoral College. The Electoral College is an outdated and undemocratic system that has no place in our 21st century democracy.\\n\\nThe Electoral College was created in the 18th century as a compromise between the large states and the small states. The large states wanted the president to be elected by popular vote, while the small states wanted each state to have an equal number of votes. The Electoral College was a way to satisfy both groups.\\n\\nHowever, the Electoral College is no longer necessary. The United States is no longer a collection of small, independent states. It is a unified nation with a strong central government. In a nation as large and diverse as the United States, it is only fair that the president be elected by the people.\\n\\nThe Electoral College is also undemocratic. It is possible for a candidate to win the popular vote but lose the election. This has happened five times in American history, most recently in 2016. In that election, Hillary Clinton won the popular vote by more than 3 million votes, but Donald Trump won the Electoral College and became president.\\n\\nThe Electoral College also gives more power to the small states than they deserve. In a state with a small population, each vote counts more than it does in a state with a large population. This means that people in small states have more of a say in who becomes president than people in large states.\\n\\nI urge you to support a constitutional amendment that would abolish the Electoral College and elect the president by popular vote. This is the only way to ensure that every vote counts and that we have a truly democratic election.\\n\\nThank you for your time and consideration.\\n\\nSincerely,\",\n          \"Back in the day they did'nt have technology.

I agree with this statement. We has to have a good attitude everyday in everywhere. In the work, school, and in the house.\\n\\nFirts, I agree because the attitude is one of the main charisma in a person. In the work everyone has to have a good character with attitude because is important to be a good workers. In the work is very important to arrive all the time with good attitude and be amiable. The customer can stay happy with the workers work with a good attitude. The customer give tips, and the workers are happy. The workers don't have problems with the chief or the boss.\\n\\nSecond, I think that the attitude is important have in the school because every student have to go to the school everyday with a good attitude. The attitude is one of the main charisma that a student has to have. The students with a good attitude everyone spectable by othres students. The attitude is important to have friendly relations. When they are graduated they remenber that it's important to be good with others and continued in to be good person with a good attitude.\\n\\nFinally, in the house it's important to keep a good character with good attitude. I think that in the family is more important to have a good attitude. If everyone have a good attitude we live in armony and don't had problems to each others. The attitude in the family is one of the most important that everyone has and live without of problems.\\n\\nIn conclusion, the attitude is one of the main charism that one person can had. many people don't have a good attitude with others , but it's important have good attitude in everywhere to be a good people.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n","1     Having school every single day is nobodies favorite free time to others it's there favorite hobby it also takes time and alot of studying to. There making everything so easy for us this year they will do 3 years of high school if I studying really hard to not stay for all 4 years by that addition they will be including to have courses during on summers or in evenings or may not be able to take elective courses. Which will be really helpful for me to have more hours to myself more of my free time I could studying way more to. More than I knew about these prgrams im glad I found about it because it can be a big change for me and everybody else. It's a 50 50 deal to me because your going to miss on 1 year ,but also you can do so much go apply to colleges and have a job because you would have more time for all the better thats coming to you.\\n\\nOn the outcome you would be helping yourself out spend your summer on school time or you can have less hours of going to school on evenings sleep in more in the miday. All 4 years you can be doing the total of 3 years you would just be doing fulltime but it's also the choice you make on evenings or in the summer days. Luckily you can do anthing what you want and could imagine if you can put your mind to it and it will appear better days. Although everything in life you will get because its how you want your future to be but if it's for you it will not go away. At any age you can graduate young or as a older person but when you do you will be a successful leader.\\n\\nMy main priority in life is school since I was a child I always love coming in to school it was always my focus in life to overcome the end of it. School has always been my favorite because you saw your friends and it's how you start your day also good connection than having a studying buddy to make everything work. A high school deploma is your way to the next door it's access to everything you will ever need later on to your future. After your done high school you will be feeling as a pot of gold apply in purssure and you will get there apply to many awesome colleges and now that you have time you can have a job. The program is an outstanding choice and make the choice now your missing on a life time opportunity.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n","2     I strongly believe art classes such as drama, acting, and music should not be a requirement for students. I also strongly believe that students should have freedom to choose which elective him or her want's to take. A student that has the freedom to choose his or hers electives, he or she views the classes as more divers fun and interactive, then required art classes.\\n\\nFirst of all most people believes that all students are required to take art class, music, and drama class. Most of all others think that students will actually cooperate to there fullest, and pass the class with higher letter grads. Like in an unrequited class most students will not actually take the art classes seriously, and fail with low letter grades. In comparison students with a required class will most likely take the class seriously knowing if they dont tighten up, and do what is asked the'll get low grades on multiple assignments like projects, class projects, and event tests. An nonparticipating students score will drop significantly. Which in fact they are wrong student shouldnt have to take the art classes to begin with.\\n\\nIn my true opinion student should have the chance to express his or her true feelings, and reach a main goal in life. People arent going to tell use students what career paths to fallow we simply choose our own paths. Really in fact art classes should be an elective instead of it having to be required. Art classes are fun I my self take art by choose and enjoy ever single part of it. Again arts should not be a requirement for students it is unethical, and unheard of as far as i know.\\n\\nMusic, drama, and art class are three amazing electives, and forever will be electives. what sense is it to make an art class a requirement to pass? No sense in my opinion art allows us students to express out inner happiness, deepest emotions, and embrace them. However, at the end of the day art classes should be and always stay an elective. What use will it be to us students in the real world? No use at all, unless a student wants to fallow a career path in art.\\n\\nAll the more reasons why I know art classes such as drama, acting, and music classes should not be a requirement for students. Electives are much more divers, fun, and interactive. Also students should have the freedom to choose his or her electives. There is no sense in making an art class a requiermnet for use students. Most students are not fallowing a type of caree in art, and will not be of much use to us in the future.                                                                                                                                          \n","3     Mr. manager i want to explore certain occupation through internships and shadowing i read that you are given the opportunities to student to explore a certain occupation;I want to learn about how became a teacher i like this profession and i think this is my opportunities to discover all of the things about this profession.\\n\\nOne of the reason is because i want to help children in a school and teach all of the things that they need to know for their future .\\n\\nI can teach to parents that parents want finish a career and they want to finish and have a diploma so they can have a better job for that reasons is what i want to be a teacher so i can help people with education this is why i hope you can give me this opportunities, because i want to learn all the thing that i needed to this profession.\\n\\nOne example why i chose this profession is because when i was a child i see my parents they want to help me when i have homework but they dont know a lot of thing because they not have the opportunities to go a school if i can be a teacher i want to teach that kind of people i hope you can give me this opportunities.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  \n","4     Introduction:\\n\\nThe author of \"The Challenge of Exploring Venus\" thinks that studying Venus is a good idea even though it's really dangerous. In this essay, I will say why I agree with the author and why I think they do a good job of proving their point.\\n\\nBody:\\n\\nFirst, the author says that Venus is like Earth in some ways, like how they're both rocky planets with atmospheres. This means that studying Venus can help us learn more about Earth and how it works. For example, the author says that Venus's thick atmosphere could help us understand how Earth's atmosphere works and how it affects the weather. This is a good reason to study Venus even though it's dangerous because it can help us learn more about our own planet.\\n\\nSecond, the author says that studying Venus can help us learn more about the universe in general. Venus is different from Earth in a lot of ways, like how it's way hotter and has a really thick atmosphere. Studying these differences can help us understand how other planets in the universe might be different from Earth too. This can help us learn more about the universe and how it works.\\n\\nFinally, the author says that studying Venus can help us find new ways to live on other planets. Venus is a lot like Earth, but it's also really different. If we can figure out how to live on Venus, we might be able to figure out how to live on other planets that are similar to Earth. This could be really important in the future if Earth gets too crowded or if we need to find a new home.\\n\\nConclusion:\\n\\nIn conclusion, the author of \"The Challenge of Exploring Venus\" does a good job of proving that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit even though it's dangerous. They give lots of reasons why studying Venus can help us learn more about Earth, the universe, and even how to live on other planets. I think that studying Venus is a good idea too, and I hope that scientists can figure out how to do it safely so that we can learn more about this really interesting planet.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \n","...                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    ...                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \n","5529  Introduction:\\nHey there! I know you're really into the idea that aliens created the Face on Mars, but let me tell you, as a NASA scientist, I'm here to convinced you that it's just a natural landform. I know, I know, it looks like a face, but sometimes nature can be pretty clever. In this essay, I'll explain why I think the Face is just a regular ol' hill.\\n\\nClaim 1: The Face is just a hill with shadows.\\nThe article states that \"the Face is simply a hill with a particularly symmetrical arrangement of shadows\" (Paragraph 3). This means that when the sun shines on the hill, it creates shadows that make it look like a face. It's like when you see a rabbit in the clouds - it's just a trick of the light! If you look at the picture in the article, you can see that the \"face\" is actually just a bunch of shadows and highlights.\\n\\nClaim 2: The Face is made of natural materials.\\nThe article also mentions that the Face is made of \"a hill of rock and soil\" (Paragraph 2). This means that it's not some weird, alien material - it's just regular old Earth stuff. And, as the article points out, \"the soil and rocks found on Mars are similar to those found on Earth\" (Paragraph 4). So, it's not like aliens came down and dumped some strange, face-making material on the planet. It's just nature doing its thing.\\n\\nClaim 3: Other natural features on Mars look like faces too.\\nThe article talks about how other natural features on Mars also look like faces (Paragraph 5). This means that it's not just the Face that looks like a face - other things on the planet do too! It's like how you might see a face in a cloud or a tree trunk. It's just our brains being silly and seeing patterns where there aren't any.\\n\\nEvidence from the article to support my claims:\\n\\n* \"the Face is simply a hill with a particularly symmetrical arrangement of shadows\" (Paragraph 3)\\n* \"the soil and rocks found on Mars are similar to those found on Earth\" (Paragraph 4)\\n* \"other natural features on Mars also look like faces\" (Paragraph 5)\\n\\nConclusion:\\nSo, there you have it! The Face on Mars might look like a face, but it's actually just a natural landform. It's made of regular stuff like rocks and soil, and it's just a trick of the light that makes it look like a face. I hope I've convinced you that there's no need to call in the aliens - it's just good old Mother Nature doing her thing.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \n","5530  My uncle has in his wallet 100 dollars, he give to me 10 and stay with the rest,I tell him to save the money for tomorrow he well need it, but he spend all the money to buy shirt pants and hats, and the next day he was asking for money for the gas for the car. My unclewas happy for the money and to buy things with the money and fro not listen we was need it for tomorrow. He spend all the money in things that are good for him but he knowing he will need it, for tomorrow he spended it, are all.\\n\\nWhy seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choise. Once of my friend was having money on his paket he says,\"lets go whatch a movie on the cinema\". but all the rest of my friend we tell him to \"NO\", Because the movie was aready in CD and was much less money than go whatch it in the cinema. When my friend recibe ours opinions we see the situation in other perspective of the he was thinking. Even my friend want to whatch the movie on the cinema, should be a to spend a lot of money to pay. and that how we tell him to buy it.\\n\\nWhen people ask for advice, they sometimes talk to more than one person. My Dad give to be money to buy anything that i want, knowing that tomorrow I will need a white shirt, I buy a game and my dad tell me about the place that we need to go and will need the shirt and for my obsession for the game the nezt day was asking if they can give me money to buy the shirt, and my dad tell me yesterday,\"I tell you to buy it, but you don't listen to me\". Even I was knowing about the shirt, this happen because i did't listen, In adition, all the talk and learning, and that day after the money I save it for this type of case.\\n\\nThe case that happen in resume, all talk about how important is that to listen to the people around you, All this situation happens because there were listen to the person next to it.\\n\\nand you, In sometimes is okay to that more than one person talk to you?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               \n","5531  \\nSeeking advice from more than one person when making an important decision or choice can be very beneficial. Getting different perspectives allows you to look at the situation from various angles and get input on both the pros and cons of each option. No single person is likely to have all the information or viewpoints needed to make the optimal choice. \\n\\nTalking to multiple people helps ensure you don't miss important factors to consider. Different people will know different details relevant to your situation based on their background and experiences. Bringing more minds together brings more collective information to the table. For example, if choosing between schools to attend, asking teachers, parents and past students can surface important insights about academics, costs, extracurricular offerings and school culture that just one person may not provide.\\n\\nSeeking multiple opinions also helps account for any biases a single adviser may have. We all have unconscious biases that can slant our advice in a certain direction without us meaning to. But getting feedback from more impartial parties who don't have the same inherent biases helps balance out those influences. You're less likely to be steered down a non-optimal path if more voices are part of the decision making process. \\n\\nPerhaps most importantly, considering a range of perspectives promotes more thorough critical thinking on your end. Discussing pros and cons with different people requires actively thinking through tradeoffs and hypothetical outcomes. This strengthens your own analysis and helps ensure your final choice factors in multiple important criteria rather than just a single top priority or impression. The stakes are higher and your decision is more well-informed when you use the collective insights of several trusted advisers rather than just one.\\n\\nIn conclusion, seeking multiple opinions provides more complete information, reduces potential personal biases, and cultivates stronger critical thinking - all of which can lead to a “better” choice. Making important decisions alone deprives you of these benefits, so consulting with friends, family members, and experts is wise whenever the option is available. The views of one person, no matter how close, are rarely sufficient for complex choices that impact our lives in major ways.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 \n","5532  Dear Principal Smith,\\n\\nI am writing to you regarding the proposal to require all students to perform community service. While helping our community is certainly admirable, I do not think mandatory service is the best approach. \\n\\nForcing students to volunteer takes away the spirit of service. Community organizations rely on kindhearted volunteers who genuinely want to help others. Students who are required to volunteer may perceive it as a burden rather than an opportunity. They may half-heartedly go through the motions without truly committing to their role, which would not provide as meaningful an experience for those being helped. \\n\\nInstead of making service mandatory, I think inspiring students' internal motivation would be more effective. Students could be educated on the important role that volunteers play and the impact they can make. Highlighting success stories and testimonials from grateful community members may encourage some to volunteer of their own accord. For those still unsure, optional service opportunities could be provided to allow interested students to try it out and see the rewards of volunteering firsthand. \\n\\nWhile the intention of mandating service is to encourage selflessness, it may backfire by fostering resentment. A better approach is to lead by example and cultivate students' empathy and care for others and urge them to serve out of their own sense of compassion. Not all students may feel ready, but many would rise to the occasion if given the opportunity to volunteer freely according to their own interests and schedule. Overall, inspiring voluntary service through positivity, not requirements, will likely achieve the most meaningful results for both students and the community in the long run.\\n\\nI hope you will consider these views as you make your decision. The choice to volunteer or not should be left up to the individual student. However, I'm sure that with the right encouragement, many will step up to help our community through their own motivated choice.\\n\\nSincerely,\\n[Your name]                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  \n","5533  The implementation of a four-day school week with extended hours for primary and secondary schools in the United States has been a topic of discussion for several years. While some argue that this would be beneficial for students and teachers, others believe it would have negative impacts on the economy and academics. In this essay, I will examine the viability of this proposal and analyze arguments for and against, considering economic and academic impacts, and suggest a conclusion that balances these concerns.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne of the main arguments in favor of a four-day school week is that it would reduce stress levels for students and teachers. With fewer days in school, students would have more time to relax and engage in extracurricular activities, while teachers would have more time to plan and prepare for lessons. Additionally, extended hours would allow for more time for students to receive individualized attention from their teachers, which could lead to improved academic performance.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the other hand, opponents argue that a four-day school week would negatively impact the economy. With fewer school days, businesses would have to adjust their schedules, which could lead to decreased productivity and increased costs. Additionally, some argue that schools would need to hire more teachers to cover the extended hours, which would be expensive and could lead to higher taxes.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnother argument against a four-day school week is that it could negatively impact academics. Some argue that students would not have enough time to complete their work, which could lead to decreased academic performance. Additionally, some argue that the extended hours would not necessarily lead to improved academic performance, as students may not use the extra time effectively.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn conclusion, while the implementation of a four-day school week with extended hours for primary and secondary schools in the United States has its benefits, it also has its drawbacks. While it may reduce stress levels for students and teachers, it could negatively impact the economy and academics. To balance these concerns, schools could consider implementing a hybrid model, where students attend school for four days and work from home one day. This would allow for more flexibility and reduce the need for extended hours while still providing students with individualized attention from their teachers. Ultimately, the decision to implement a four-day school week with extended hours should be based on a careful analysis of the economic and academic impacts, as well as the needs and preferences of students, teachers, and the community.   \n","\n","     generated  \\\n","0     0          \n","1     0          \n","2     0          \n","3     0          \n","4     1          \n","...  ..          \n","5529  1          \n","5530  0          \n","5531  1          \n","5532  1          \n","5533  1          \n","\n","                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      prompt_id  \\\n","0     Task: Write an essay discussing why attitude is an important charisma for success in life.

I also strongly believe that students should have freedom to choose which elective him or her want's to take. A student that has the freedom to choose his or hers electives, he or she views the classes as more divers fun and interactive, then required art classes.\\n\\nFirst of all most people believes that all students are required to take art class, music, and drama class. Most of all others think that students will actually cooperate to there fullest, and pass the class with higher letter grads. Like in an unrequited class most students will not actually take the art classes seriously, and fail with low letter grades. In comparison students with a required class will most likely take the class seriously knowing if they dont tighten up, and do what is asked the'll get low grades on multiple assignments like projects, class projects, and event tests. An nonparticipating students score will drop significantly. Which in fact they are wrong student shouldnt have to take the art classes to begin with.\\n\\nIn my true opinion student should have the chance to express his or her true feelings, and reach a main goal in life. People arent going to tell use students what career paths to fallow we simply choose our own paths. Really in fact art classes should be an elective instead of it having to be required. Art classes are fun I my self take art by choose and enjoy ever single part of it. Again arts should not be a requirement for students it is unethical, and unheard of as far as i know.\\n\\nMusic, drama, and art class are three amazing electives, and forever will be electives. what sense is it to make an art class a requirement to pass? No sense in my opinion art allows us students to express out inner happiness, deepest emotions, and embrace them. However, at the end of the day art classes should be and always stay an elective. What use will it be to us students in the real world? No use at all, unless a student wants to fallow a career path in art.\\n\\nAll the more reasons why I know art classes such as drama, acting, and music classes should not be a requirement for students. Electives are much more divers, fun, and interactive. Also students should have the freedom to choose his or her electives. There is no sense in making an art class a requiermnet for use students.

In this essay, I will say why I agree with the author and why I think they do a good job of proving their point.\\n\\nBody:\\n\\nFirst, the author says that Venus is like Earth in some ways, like how they're both rocky planets with atmospheres. This means that studying Venus can help us learn more about Earth and how it works. For example, the author says that Venus's thick atmosphere could help us understand how Earth's atmosphere works and how it affects the weather. This is a good reason to study Venus even though it's dangerous because it can help us learn more about our own planet.\\n\\nSecond, the author says that studying Venus can help us learn more about the universe in general. Venus is different from Earth in a lot of ways, like how it's way hotter and has a really thick atmosphere. Studying these differences can help us understand how other planets in the universe might be different from Earth too. This can help us learn more about the universe and how it works.\\n\\nFinally, the author says that studying Venus can help us find new ways to live on other planets. Venus is a lot like Earth, but it's also really different. If we can figure out how to live on Venus, we might be able to figure out how to live on other planets that are similar to Earth. This could be really important in the future if Earth gets too crowded or if we need to find a new home.\\n\\nConclusion:\\n\\nIn conclusion, the author of \"The Challenge of Exploring Venus\" does a good job of proving that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit even though it's dangerous. They give lots of reasons why studying Venus can help us learn more about Earth, the universe, and even how to live on other planets. I think that studying Venus is a good idea too, and I hope that scientists can figure out how to do it safely so that we can learn more about this really interesting planet.</td>\n","      <td>1</td>\n","      <td>In \"The Challenge of Exploring Venus,\" the author suggests studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents.

I know you're really into the idea that aliens created the Face on Mars, but let me tell you, as a NASA scientist, I'm here to convinced you that it's just a natural landform. I know, I know, it looks like a face, but sometimes nature can be pretty clever. In this essay, I'll explain why I think the Face is just a regular ol' hill.\\n\\nClaim 1: The Face is just a hill with shadows.\\nThe article states that \"the Face is simply a hill with a particularly symmetrical arrangement of shadows\" (Paragraph 3). This means that when the sun shines on the hill, it creates shadows that make it look like a face. It's like when you see a rabbit in the clouds - it's just a trick of the light! If you look at the picture in the article, you can see that the \"face\" is actually just a bunch of shadows and highlights.\\n\\nClaim 2: The Face is made of natural materials.\\nThe article also mentions that the Face is made of \"a hill of rock and soil\" (Paragraph 2). This means that it's not some weird, alien material - it's just regular old Earth stuff. And, as the article points out, \"the soil and rocks found on Mars are similar to those found on Earth\" (Paragraph 4). So, it's not like aliens came down and dumped some strange, face-making material on the planet. It's just nature doing its thing.\\n\\nClaim 3: Other natural features on Mars look like faces too.\\nThe article talks about how other natural features on Mars also look like faces (Paragraph 5). This means that it's not just the Face that looks like a face - other things on the planet do too! It's like how you might see a face in a cloud or a tree trunk. It's just our brains being silly and seeing patterns where there aren't any.\\n\\nEvidence from the article to support my claims:\\n\\n* \"the Face is simply a hill with a particularly symmetrical arrangement of shadows\" (Paragraph 3)\\n* \"the soil and rocks found on Mars are similar to those found on Earth\" (Paragraph 4)\\n* \"other natural features on Mars also look like faces\" (Paragraph 5)\\n\\nConclusion:\\nSo, there you have it! The Face on Mars might look like a face, but it's actually just a natural landform. It's made of regular stuff like rocks and soil, and it's just a trick of the light that makes it look like a face. I hope I've convinced you that there's no need to call in the aliens - it's just good old Mother Nature doing her thing.</td>\n","      <td>1</td>\n","      <td>You have read the article 'Unmasking the Face on Mars.'

Getting different perspectives allows you to look at the situation from various angles and get input on both the pros and cons of each option. No single person is likely to have all the information or viewpoints needed to make the optimal choice. \\n\\nTalking to multiple people helps ensure you don't miss important factors to consider. Different people will know different details relevant to your situation based on their background and experiences. Bringing more minds together brings more collective information to the table. For example, if choosing between schools to attend, asking teachers, parents and past students can surface important insights about academics, costs, extracurricular offerings and school culture that just one person may not provide.\\n\\nSeeking multiple opinions also helps account for any biases a single adviser may have. We all have unconscious biases that can slant our advice in a certain direction without us meaning to. But getting feedback from more impartial parties who don't have the same inherent biases helps balance out those influences. You're less likely to be steered down a non-optimal path if more voices are part of the decision making process. \\n\\nPerhaps most importantly, considering a range of perspectives promotes more thorough critical thinking on your end. Discussing pros and cons with different people requires actively thinking through tradeoffs and hypothetical outcomes. This strengthens your own analysis and helps ensure your final choice factors in multiple important criteria rather than just a single top priority or impression. The stakes are higher and your decision is more well-informed when you use the collective insights of several trusted advisers rather than just one.\\n\\nIn conclusion, seeking multiple opinions provides more complete information, reduces potential personal biases, and cultivates stronger critical thinking - all of which can lead to a “better” choice. Making important decisions alone deprives you of these benefits, so consulting with friends, family members, and experts is wise whenever the option is available. The views of one person, no matter how close, are rarely sufficient for complex choices that impact our lives in major ways.</td>\n","      <td>1</td>\n","      <td>NaN</td>\n","      <td>darragh_claude_v6</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>5532</th>\n","      <td>Dear Principal Smith,\\n\\nI am writing to you regarding the proposal to require all students to perform community service. While helping our community is certainly admirable, I do not think mandatory service is the best approach. \\n\\nForcing students to volunteer takes away the spirit of service. Community organizations rely on kindhearted volunteers who genuinely want to help others. Students who are required to volunteer may perceive it as a burden rather than an opportunity. They may half-heartedly go through the motions without truly committing to their role, which would not provide as meaningful an experience for those being helped. \\n\\nInstead of making service mandatory, I think inspiring students' internal motivation would be more effective. Students could be educated on the important role that volunteers play and the impact they can make. Highlighting success stories and testimonials from grateful community members may encourage some to volunteer of their own accord. For those still unsure, optional service opportunities could be provided to allow interested students to try it out and see the rewards of volunteering firsthand. \\n\\nWhile the intention of mandating service is to encourage selflessness, it may backfire by fostering resentment. A better approach is to lead by example and cultivate students' empathy and care for others and urge them to serve out of their own sense of compassion. Not all students may feel ready, but many would rise to the occasion if given the opportunity to volunteer freely according to their own interests and schedule. Overall, inspiring voluntary service through positivity, not requirements, will likely achieve the most meaningful results for both students and the community in the long run.\\n\\nI hope you will consider these views as you make your decision. The choice to volunteer or not should be left up to the individual student. However, I'm sure that with the right encouragement, many will step up to help our community through their own motivated choice.\\n\\nSincerely,\\n[Your name]</td>\n","      <td>1</td>\n","      <td>NaN</td>\n","      <td>darragh_claude_v6</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>5533</th>\n","      <td>The implementation of a four-day school week with extended hours for primary and secondary schools in the United States has been a topic of discussion for several years. While some argue that this would be beneficial for students and teachers, others believe it would have negative impacts on the economy and academics. In this essay, I will examine the viability of this proposal and analyze arguments for and against, considering economic and academic impacts, and suggest a conclusion that balances these concerns.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne of the main arguments in favor of a four-day school week is that it would reduce stress levels for students and teachers. With fewer days in school, students would have more time to relax and engage in extracurricular activities, while teachers would have more time to plan and prepare for lessons. Additionally, extended hours would allow for more time for students to receive individualized attention from their teachers, which could lead to improved academic performance.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the other hand, opponents argue that a four-day school week would negatively impact the economy. With fewer school days, businesses would have to adjust their schedules, which could lead to decreased productivity and increased costs. Additionally, some argue that schools would need to hire more teachers to cover the extended hours, which would be expensive and could lead to higher taxes.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnother argument against a four-day school week is that it could negatively impact academics. Some argue that students would not have enough time to complete their work, which could lead to decreased academic performance. Additionally, some argue that the extended hours would not necessarily lead to improved academic performance, as students may not use the extra time effectively.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn conclusion, while the implementation of a four-day school week with extended hours for primary and secondary schools in the United States has its benefits, it also has its drawbacks. While it may reduce stress levels for students and teachers, it could negatively impact the economy and academics. To balance these concerns, schools could consider implementing a hybrid model, where students attend school for four days and work from home one day. This would allow for more flexibility and reduce the need for extended hours while still providing students with individualized attention from their teachers. Ultimately, the decision to implement a four-day school week with extended hours should be based on a careful analysis of the economic and academic impacts, as well as the needs and preferences of students, teachers, and the community.</td>\n","      <td>1</td>\n","      <td>NaN</td>\n","      <td>mistral7binstruct_v1</td>\n","    </tr>\n","  </tbody>\n","</table>\n","<p>5534 rows × 4 columns</p>\n","</div>\n","    <div class=\"colab-df-buttons\">\n","\n","  <div class=\"colab-df-container\">\n","    <button class=\"colab-df-convert\" onclick=\"convertToInteractive('df-f7f1fbd8-0485-4caf-8b45-9d767ac77fc5')\"\n","            title=\"Convert this dataframe to an interactive table.\"\n","            style=\"display:none;\">\n","\n","  <svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" height=\"24px\" viewBox=\"0 -960 960 960\">\n","    <path d=\"M120-120v-720h720v720H120Zm60-500h600v-160H180v160Zm220 220h160v-160H400v160Zm0 220h160v-160H400v160ZM180-400h160v-160H180v160Zm440 0h160v-160H620v160ZM180-180h160v-160H180v160Zm440 0h160v-160H620v160Z\"/>\n","  </svg>\n","    </button>\n","\n","  <style>\n","    .colab-df-container {\n","      display:flex;\n","      gap: 12px;\n","    }\n","\n","    .colab-df-convert {\n","      background-color: #E8F0FE;\n","      border: none;\n","      border-radius: 50%;\n","      cursor: pointer;\n","      display: none;\n","      fill: #1967D2;\n","      height: 32px;\n","      padding: 0 0 0 0;\n","      width: 32px;\n","    }\n","\n","    .colab-df-convert:hover {\n","      background-color: #E2EBFA;\n","      box-shadow: 0px 1px 2px rgba(60, 64, 67, 0.3), 0px 1px 3px 1px rgba(60, 64, 67, 0.15);\n","      fill: #174EA6;\n","    }\n","\n","    .colab-df-buttons div {\n","      margin-bottom: 4px;\n","    }\n","\n","    [theme=dark] .colab-df-convert {\n","      background-color: #3B4455;\n","      fill: #D2E3FC;\n","    }\n","\n","    [theme=dark] .colab-df-convert:hover {\n","      background-color: #434B5C;\n","      box-shadow: 0px 1px 3px 1px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.15);\n","      filter: drop-shadow(0px 1px 2px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.3));\n","      fill: #FFFFFF;\n","    }\n","  </style>\n","\n","    <script>\n","      const buttonEl =\n","        document.querySelector('#df-f7f1fbd8-0485-4caf-8b45-9d767ac77fc5 button.colab-df-convert');\n","      buttonEl.style.display =\n","        google.colab.kernel.accessAllowed ?

It has a lot of meanings. It has a lot of ways to describe.\\n\\nPosition:\\n\\nMi position is negative for the word influence. It gets othes in wrong ways. It is the word that convince othes to do somthing.\\n\\nFor example:\\n\\nSomebody offer you some beer, wine, or drugs that are bad influence. If a friend say to you, hey come on lets stole that bicicle it's a bad influence. I now some people that they copy the stile life from others that is not right, so that is the bad influence. Infuence is when somebody buys things that are not health, like Mc donal's, red bulls or chips those are bad influence for you.\\n\\nConclusion:\\n\\nIn my conclusion I think that influencing others is not good because it to force many people to do several things wrong. It convince many children to go throught bad ways. However, the word influence can be exellent too. It can describes many things that can be good in your work or in your life.\",\n          \"The quote says, \\\"Unless you try to do something beyond what you already mastered, you will never grow.\\\" I disagree with this statement. Because people need extend their studies, so that they can learn new important information that can benefit new research, also they can set new ideas, so they can make new studies and discoveries. Thirdly they can grow by teaching other people how to learn the same material . You can grow be doing a lot of different activities and teaching methods\\n\\nFirst way to grow is to try to learn more by studying. This is an important factor to learn more about in full detail like Isaac newton he discovers the law of gravity because of an apple that fell on top of his head. Then he makes a lot of theories about what may cause such phenomenon, so he studied it by creating equations and and a math subject called Calculus. Their are many others for example: Shakespeare, Beethoven, Albert Einstein, Stephen Hawkins, and Leonardo DaVince. These smart men did not stop because their is always something new to discover and grow.\\n\\nSecond way to grow is discovering new information. Every single day people learn something new, which is a benefit our society weather it's good or bad because you can have new ideas or discoveries. An example is cancer. A deathly decease that can kill you and there is no cure. Scientist are doing experiment on trying to find a cure and that takes a lot of time to gather information. These scientist do not stop even though they mastered science. They want to continue helping people from suffering this bad decease they want to grow and learn more they will not stop until they find a cure, so people can live as long as possible with their families.\\n\\nThird way to grow is by teaching other people. Teaching other people can help you be a better person and letting people know your methods, so they can succeed with your help. Doing that will help yourself and other. It's another way to a good mentality, also you can grow bigger.\\n\\nIn conclusion there are different ways to grow even though you mastered it. That is why I disagree with this statement, and their is never enough or to good to learn. I will never get tired of learning new fascinating stuff about this world and the outer world.\",\n          \"Is it good idea for high school students, the can graduate in three years instead of traditional four years? Some school distract offer program that allow high school students to graduate in three years instead of four years. Most high school students who follow this plan must take courses during the summer or may not be able to take elective courses. If students end up their high school in three year, the would missed most of opportunities that could provide better knowledge and education for them. Students should not require to graduate in three years instead of four years because students could't get enough credits to graduate, and students can not improve their confidence and their knowledge.\\n\\nTo begin with, first reason, students could't receive enough credits to graduate. For example, when college student want to be successful Doctor, he or she must get enough classes during the 7 years to receive approximately credits to get their diploma, if the require to graduate in 5 years, the can't construct enough confidence to be a good Doctor for the community and society. This example shows, students should't graduate early, because the can't developed and improve their life skills, education, and knowledge. If students graduate early, the would get an anxiety and different kinda problems in their life. High school traditional four years is the natural path that can help student to be success and give them more educational opportunities.\\n\\nFurthermore, second reason, students can't improve or developed their confidence and their knowledge. For example, when the student who graduated early try to do an experiment he/she would't believe their decision and the does't have any positive confidence to get the result successful. This example shows, students should not graduate early, because the would't have any strong confidence to do something successful. Students should't required to graduate in three years instead of traditional four years of high school. If students graduate in three years of high school, the will face to anxiety problems, challenges, and work challenges.\\n\\nSome people's argue that, students should be require to graduate in three years because students will receive the most opportunity to continue their education skills. For example, when I was in Afghanistan I was about to graduate high school in 2 years, also I had the most opportunities to receive grateful education. However, students should't be require to finish their high school in three years instead of four years because students would be leftover from others and the would never confidence on the experiment and life skills. Students should't graduate in three years, the should take the elective classes to get more information about the world, regions and humans.\\n\\nIn conclusion, Students should not require to graduate in three years instead of four years because students could't get enough credits to graduate, and students can not improve their confidence and their knowledge. However, Some people's argue that, students should be require to graduate in three years because students will receive the most opportunity to continue their education skills.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"generated\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"date\",\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 1,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          1,\n          0\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"prompt_id\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2490,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Task: Write an essay discussing whether the greatest accomplishment in the world is being yourself in a world that is trying to change the person you are.\",\n          \"Task: Write an essay about the benefits of talking to more than one person to seek multiple opinions and make better choices.

I agree with this statement. We has to have a good attitude everyday in everywhere. In the work, school, and in the house.\\n\\nFirts, I agree because the attitude is one of the main charisma in a person. In the work everyone has to have a good character with attitude because is important to be a good workers. In the work is very important to arrive all the time with good attitude and be amiable. The customer can stay happy with the workers work with a good attitude. The customer give tips, and the workers are happy. The workers don't have problems with the chief or the boss.\\n\\nSecond, I think that the attitude is important have in the school because every student have to go to the school everyday with a good attitude. The attitude is one of the main charisma that a student has to have. The students with a good attitude everyone spectable by othres students. The attitude is important to have friendly relations. When they are graduated they remenber that it's important to be good with others and continued in to be good person with a good attitude.\\n\\nFinally, in the house it's important to keep a good character with good attitude. I think that in the family is more important to have a good attitude. If everyone have a good attitude we live in armony and don't had problems to each others. The attitude in the family is one of the most important that everyone has and live without of problems.\\n\\nIn conclusion, the attitude is one of the main charism that one person can had. many people don't have a good attitude with others , but it's important have good attitude in everywhere to be a good people.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n","1     Having school every single day is nobodies favorite free time to others it's there favorite hobby it also takes time and alot of studying to. There making everything so easy for us this year they will do 3 years of high school if I studying really hard to not stay for all 4 years by that addition they will be including to have courses during on summers or in evenings or may not be able to take elective courses. Which will be really helpful for me to have more hours to myself more of my free time I could studying way more to. More than I knew about these prgrams im glad I found about it because it can be a big change for me and everybody else. It's a 50 50 deal to me because your going to miss on 1 year ,but also you can do so much go apply to colleges and have a job because you would have more time for all the better thats coming to you.\\n\\nOn the outcome you would be helping yourself out spend your summer on school time or you can have less hours of going to school on evenings sleep in more in the miday. All 4 years you can be doing the total of 3 years you would just be doing fulltime but it's also the choice you make on evenings or in the summer days. Luckily you can do anthing what you want and could imagine if you can put your mind to it and it will appear better days. Although everything in life you will get because its how you want your future to be but if it's for you it will not go away. At any age you can graduate young or as a older person but when you do you will be a successful leader.\\n\\nMy main priority in life is school since I was a child I always love coming in to school it was always my focus in life to overcome the end of it. School has always been my favorite because you saw your friends and it's how you start your day also good connection than having a studying buddy to make everything work. A high school deploma is your way to the next door it's access to everything you will ever need later on to your future. After your done high school you will be feeling as a pot of gold apply in purssure and you will get there apply to many awesome colleges and now that you have time you can have a job. The program is an outstanding choice and make the choice now your missing on a life time opportunity.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n","2     I strongly believe art classes such as drama, acting, and music should not be a requirement for students. I also strongly believe that students should have freedom to choose which elective him or her want's to take. A student that has the freedom to choose his or hers electives, he or she views the classes as more divers fun and interactive, then required art classes.\\n\\nFirst of all most people believes that all students are required to take art class, music, and drama class. Most of all others think that students will actually cooperate to there fullest, and pass the class with higher letter grads. Like in an unrequited class most students will not actually take the art classes seriously, and fail with low letter grades. In comparison students with a required class will most likely take the class seriously knowing if they dont tighten up, and do what is asked the'll get low grades on multiple assignments like projects, class projects, and event tests. An nonparticipating students score will drop significantly. Which in fact they are wrong student shouldnt have to take the art classes to begin with.\\n\\nIn my true opinion student should have the chance to express his or her true feelings, and reach a main goal in life. People arent going to tell use students what career paths to fallow we simply choose our own paths. Really in fact art classes should be an elective instead of it having to be required. Art classes are fun I my self take art by choose and enjoy ever single part of it. Again arts should not be a requirement for students it is unethical, and unheard of as far as i know.\\n\\nMusic, drama, and art class are three amazing electives, and forever will be electives. what sense is it to make an art class a requirement to pass? No sense in my opinion art allows us students to express out inner happiness, deepest emotions, and embrace them. However, at the end of the day art classes should be and always stay an elective. What use will it be to us students in the real world? No use at all, unless a student wants to fallow a career path in art.\\n\\nAll the more reasons why I know art classes such as drama, acting, and music classes should not be a requirement for students. Electives are much more divers, fun, and interactive. Also students should have the freedom to choose his or her electives. There is no sense in making an art class a requiermnet for use students. Most students are not fallowing a type of caree in art, and will not be of much use to us in the future.                                                                                                                                          \n","3     Mr. manager i want to explore certain occupation through internships and shadowing i read that you are given the opportunities to student to explore a certain occupation;I want to learn about how became a teacher i like this profession and i think this is my opportunities to discover all of the things about this profession.\\n\\nOne of the reason is because i want to help children in a school and teach all of the things that they need to know for their future .\\n\\nI can teach to parents that parents want finish a career and they want to finish and have a diploma so they can have a better job for that reasons is what i want to be a teacher so i can help people with education this is why i hope you can give me this opportunities, because i want to learn all the thing that i needed to this profession.\\n\\nOne example why i chose this profession is because when i was a child i see my parents they want to help me when i have homework but they dont know a lot of thing because they not have the opportunities to go a school if i can be a teacher i want to teach that kind of people i hope you can give me this opportunities.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  \n","4     Introduction:\\n\\nThe author of \"The Challenge of Exploring Venus\" thinks that studying Venus is a good idea even though it's really dangerous. In this essay, I will say why I agree with the author and why I think they do a good job of proving their point.\\n\\nBody:\\n\\nFirst, the author says that Venus is like Earth in some ways, like how they're both rocky planets with atmospheres. This means that studying Venus can help us learn more about Earth and how it works. For example, the author says that Venus's thick atmosphere could help us understand how Earth's atmosphere works and how it affects the weather. This is a good reason to study Venus even though it's dangerous because it can help us learn more about our own planet.\\n\\nSecond, the author says that studying Venus can help us learn more about the universe in general. Venus is different from Earth in a lot of ways, like how it's way hotter and has a really thick atmosphere. Studying these differences can help us understand how other planets in the universe might be different from Earth too. This can help us learn more about the universe and how it works.\\n\\nFinally, the author says that studying Venus can help us find new ways to live on other planets. Venus is a lot like Earth, but it's also really different. If we can figure out how to live on Venus, we might be able to figure out how to live on other planets that are similar to Earth. This could be really important in the future if Earth gets too crowded or if we need to find a new home.\\n\\nConclusion:\\n\\nIn conclusion, the author of \"The Challenge of Exploring Venus\" does a good job of proving that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit even though it's dangerous. They give lots of reasons why studying Venus can help us learn more about Earth, the universe, and even how to live on other planets. I think that studying Venus is a good idea too, and I hope that scientists can figure out how to do it safely so that we can learn more about this really interesting planet.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \n","...                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    ...                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \n","5529  Introduction:\\nHey there! I know you're really into the idea that aliens created the Face on Mars, but let me tell you, as a NASA scientist, I'm here to convinced you that it's just a natural landform. I know, I know, it looks like a face, but sometimes nature can be pretty clever. In this essay, I'll explain why I think the Face is just a regular ol' hill.\\n\\nClaim 1: The Face is just a hill with shadows.\\nThe article states that \"the Face is simply a hill with a particularly symmetrical arrangement of shadows\" (Paragraph 3). This means that when the sun shines on the hill, it creates shadows that make it look like a face. It's like when you see a rabbit in the clouds - it's just a trick of the light! If you look at the picture in the article, you can see that the \"face\" is actually just a bunch of shadows and highlights.\\n\\nClaim 2: The Face is made of natural materials.\\nThe article also mentions that the Face is made of \"a hill of rock and soil\" (Paragraph 2). This means that it's not some weird, alien material - it's just regular old Earth stuff. And, as the article points out, \"the soil and rocks found on Mars are similar to those found on Earth\" (Paragraph 4). So, it's not like aliens came down and dumped some strange, face-making material on the planet. It's just nature doing its thing.\\n\\nClaim 3: Other natural features on Mars look like faces too.\\nThe article talks about how other natural features on Mars also look like faces (Paragraph 5). This means that it's not just the Face that looks like a face - other things on the planet do too! It's like how you might see a face in a cloud or a tree trunk. It's just our brains being silly and seeing patterns where there aren't any.\\n\\nEvidence from the article to support my claims:\\n\\n* \"the Face is simply a hill with a particularly symmetrical arrangement of shadows\" (Paragraph 3)\\n* \"the soil and rocks found on Mars are similar to those found on Earth\" (Paragraph 4)\\n* \"other natural features on Mars also look like faces\" (Paragraph 5)\\n\\nConclusion:\\nSo, there you have it! The Face on Mars might look like a face, but it's actually just a natural landform. It's made of regular stuff like rocks and soil, and it's just a trick of the light that makes it look like a face. I hope I've convinced you that there's no need to call in the aliens - it's just good old Mother Nature doing her thing.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \n","5530  My uncle has in his wallet 100 dollars, he give to me 10 and stay with the rest,I tell him to save the money for tomorrow he well need it, but he spend all the money to buy shirt pants and hats, and the next day he was asking for money for the gas for the car. My unclewas happy for the money and to buy things with the money and fro not listen we was need it for tomorrow. He spend all the money in things that are good for him but he knowing he will need it, for tomorrow he spended it, are all.\\n\\nWhy seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choise. Once of my friend was having money on his paket he says,\"lets go whatch a movie on the cinema\". but all the rest of my friend we tell him to \"NO\", Because the movie was aready in CD and was much less money than go whatch it in the cinema. When my friend recibe ours opinions we see the situation in other perspective of the he was thinking. Even my friend want to whatch the movie on the cinema, should be a to spend a lot of money to pay. and that how we tell him to buy it.\\n\\nWhen people ask for advice, they sometimes talk to more than one person. My Dad give to be money to buy anything that i want, knowing that tomorrow I will need a white shirt, I buy a game and my dad tell me about the place that we need to go and will need the shirt and for my obsession for the game the nezt day was asking if they can give me money to buy the shirt, and my dad tell me yesterday,\"I tell you to buy it, but you don't listen to me\". Even I was knowing about the shirt, this happen because i did't listen, In adition, all the talk and learning, and that day after the money I save it for this type of case.\\n\\nThe case that happen in resume, all talk about how important is that to listen to the people around you, All this situation happens because there were listen to the person next to it.\\n\\nand you, In sometimes is okay to that more than one person talk to you?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               \n","5531  \\nSeeking advice from more than one person when making an important decision or choice can be very beneficial. Getting different perspectives allows you to look at the situation from various angles and get input on both the pros and cons of each option. No single person is likely to have all the information or viewpoints needed to make the optimal choice. \\n\\nTalking to multiple people helps ensure you don't miss important factors to consider. Different people will know different details relevant to your situation based on their background and experiences. Bringing more minds together brings more collective information to the table. For example, if choosing between schools to attend, asking teachers, parents and past students can surface important insights about academics, costs, extracurricular offerings and school culture that just one person may not provide.\\n\\nSeeking multiple opinions also helps account for any biases a single adviser may have. We all have unconscious biases that can slant our advice in a certain direction without us meaning to. But getting feedback from more impartial parties who don't have the same inherent biases helps balance out those influences. You're less likely to be steered down a non-optimal path if more voices are part of the decision making process. \\n\\nPerhaps most importantly, considering a range of perspectives promotes more thorough critical thinking on your end. Discussing pros and cons with different people requires actively thinking through tradeoffs and hypothetical outcomes. This strengthens your own analysis and helps ensure your final choice factors in multiple important criteria rather than just a single top priority or impression. The stakes are higher and your decision is more well-informed when you use the collective insights of several trusted advisers rather than just one.\\n\\nIn conclusion, seeking multiple opinions provides more complete information, reduces potential personal biases, and cultivates stronger critical thinking - all of which can lead to a “better” choice. Making important decisions alone deprives you of these benefits, so consulting with friends, family members, and experts is wise whenever the option is available. The views of one person, no matter how close, are rarely sufficient for complex choices that impact our lives in major ways.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 \n","5532  Dear Principal Smith,\\n\\nI am writing to you regarding the proposal to require all students to perform community service. While helping our community is certainly admirable, I do not think mandatory service is the best approach. \\n\\nForcing students to volunteer takes away the spirit of service. Community organizations rely on kindhearted volunteers who genuinely want to help others. Students who are required to volunteer may perceive it as a burden rather than an opportunity. They may half-heartedly go through the motions without truly committing to their role, which would not provide as meaningful an experience for those being helped. \\n\\nInstead of making service mandatory, I think inspiring students' internal motivation would be more effective. Students could be educated on the important role that volunteers play and the impact they can make. Highlighting success stories and testimonials from grateful community members may encourage some to volunteer of their own accord. For those still unsure, optional service opportunities could be provided to allow interested students to try it out and see the rewards of volunteering firsthand. \\n\\nWhile the intention of mandating service is to encourage selflessness, it may backfire by fostering resentment. A better approach is to lead by example and cultivate students' empathy and care for others and urge them to serve out of their own sense of compassion. Not all students may feel ready, but many would rise to the occasion if given the opportunity to volunteer freely according to their own interests and schedule. Overall, inspiring voluntary service through positivity, not requirements, will likely achieve the most meaningful results for both students and the community in the long run.\\n\\nI hope you will consider these views as you make your decision. The choice to volunteer or not should be left up to the individual student. However, I'm sure that with the right encouragement, many will step up to help our community through their own motivated choice.\\n\\nSincerely,\\n[Your name]                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  \n","5533  The implementation of a four-day school week with extended hours for primary and secondary schools in the United States has been a topic of discussion for several years. While some argue that this would be beneficial for students and teachers, others believe it would have negative impacts on the economy and academics. In this essay, I will examine the viability of this proposal and analyze arguments for and against, considering economic and academic impacts, and suggest a conclusion that balances these concerns.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne of the main arguments in favor of a four-day school week is that it would reduce stress levels for students and teachers. With fewer days in school, students would have more time to relax and engage in extracurricular activities, while teachers would have more time to plan and prepare for lessons. Additionally, extended hours would allow for more time for students to receive individualized attention from their teachers, which could lead to improved academic performance.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the other hand, opponents argue that a four-day school week would negatively impact the economy. With fewer school days, businesses would have to adjust their schedules, which could lead to decreased productivity and increased costs. Additionally, some argue that schools would need to hire more teachers to cover the extended hours, which would be expensive and could lead to higher taxes.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnother argument against a four-day school week is that it could negatively impact academics. Some argue that students would not have enough time to complete their work, which could lead to decreased academic performance. Additionally, some argue that the extended hours would not necessarily lead to improved academic performance, as students may not use the extra time effectively.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn conclusion, while the implementation of a four-day school week with extended hours for primary and secondary schools in the United States has its benefits, it also has its drawbacks. While it may reduce stress levels for students and teachers, it could negatively impact the economy and academics. To balance these concerns, schools could consider implementing a hybrid model, where students attend school for four days and work from home one day. This would allow for more flexibility and reduce the need for extended hours while still providing students with individualized attention from their teachers. Ultimately, the decision to implement a four-day school week with extended hours should be based on a careful analysis of the economic and academic impacts, as well as the needs and preferences of students, teachers, and the community.   \n","\n","      generated  \\\n","0     0           \n","1     0           \n","2     0           \n","3     0           \n","4     1           \n","...  ..           \n","5529  1           \n","5530  0           \n","5531  1           \n","5532  1           \n","5533  1           \n","\n","                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      prompt_id  \\\n","0     Task: Write an essay discussing why attitude is an important charisma for success in life.

I also strongly believe that students should have freedom to choose which elective him or her want's to take. A student that has the freedom to choose his or hers electives, he or she views the classes as more divers fun and interactive, then required art classes.\\n\\nFirst of all most people believes that all students are required to take art class, music, and drama class. Most of all others think that students will actually cooperate to there fullest, and pass the class with higher letter grads. Like in an unrequited class most students will not actually take the art classes seriously, and fail with low letter grades. In comparison students with a required class will most likely take the class seriously knowing if they dont tighten up, and do what is asked the'll get low grades on multiple assignments like projects, class projects, and event tests. An nonparticipating students score will drop significantly. Which in fact they are wrong student shouldnt have to take the art classes to begin with.\\n\\nIn my true opinion student should have the chance to express his or her true feelings, and reach a main goal in life. People arent going to tell use students what career paths to fallow we simply choose our own paths. Really in fact art classes should be an elective instead of it having to be required. Art classes are fun I my self take art by choose and enjoy ever single part of it. Again arts should not be a requirement for students it is unethical, and unheard of as far as i know.\\n\\nMusic, drama, and art class are three amazing electives, and forever will be electives. what sense is it to make an art class a requirement to pass? No sense in my opinion art allows us students to express out inner happiness, deepest emotions, and embrace them. However, at the end of the day art classes should be and always stay an elective. What use will it be to us students in the real world? No use at all, unless a student wants to fallow a career path in art.\\n\\nAll the more reasons why I know art classes such as drama, acting, and music classes should not be a requirement for students. Electives are much more divers, fun, and interactive. Also students should have the freedom to choose his or her electives. There is no sense in making an art class a requiermnet for use students.

In this essay, I will say why I agree with the author and why I think they do a good job of proving their point.\\n\\nBody:\\n\\nFirst, the author says that Venus is like Earth in some ways, like how they're both rocky planets with atmospheres. This means that studying Venus can help us learn more about Earth and how it works. For example, the author says that Venus's thick atmosphere could help us understand how Earth's atmosphere works and how it affects the weather. This is a good reason to study Venus even though it's dangerous because it can help us learn more about our own planet.\\n\\nSecond, the author says that studying Venus can help us learn more about the universe in general. Venus is different from Earth in a lot of ways, like how it's way hotter and has a really thick atmosphere. Studying these differences can help us understand how other planets in the universe might be different from Earth too. This can help us learn more about the universe and how it works.\\n\\nFinally, the author says that studying Venus can help us find new ways to live on other planets. Venus is a lot like Earth, but it's also really different. If we can figure out how to live on Venus, we might be able to figure out how to live on other planets that are similar to Earth. This could be really important in the future if Earth gets too crowded or if we need to find a new home.\\n\\nConclusion:\\n\\nIn conclusion, the author of \"The Challenge of Exploring Venus\" does a good job of proving that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit even though it's dangerous. They give lots of reasons why studying Venus can help us learn more about Earth, the universe, and even how to live on other planets. I think that studying Venus is a good idea too, and I hope that scientists can figure out how to do it safely so that we can learn more about this really interesting planet.</td>\n","      <td>1</td>\n","      <td>In \"The Challenge of Exploring Venus,\" the author suggests studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents.

I know you're really into the idea that aliens created the Face on Mars, but let me tell you, as a NASA scientist, I'm here to convinced you that it's just a natural landform. I know, I know, it looks like a face, but sometimes nature can be pretty clever. In this essay, I'll explain why I think the Face is just a regular ol' hill.\\n\\nClaim 1: The Face is just a hill with shadows.\\nThe article states that \"the Face is simply a hill with a particularly symmetrical arrangement of shadows\" (Paragraph 3). This means that when the sun shines on the hill, it creates shadows that make it look like a face. It's like when you see a rabbit in the clouds - it's just a trick of the light! If you look at the picture in the article, you can see that the \"face\" is actually just a bunch of shadows and highlights.\\n\\nClaim 2: The Face is made of natural materials.\\nThe article also mentions that the Face is made of \"a hill of rock and soil\" (Paragraph 2). This means that it's not some weird, alien material - it's just regular old Earth stuff. And, as the article points out, \"the soil and rocks found on Mars are similar to those found on Earth\" (Paragraph 4). So, it's not like aliens came down and dumped some strange, face-making material on the planet. It's just nature doing its thing.\\n\\nClaim 3: Other natural features on Mars look like faces too.\\nThe article talks about how other natural features on Mars also look like faces (Paragraph 5). This means that it's not just the Face that looks like a face - other things on the planet do too! It's like how you might see a face in a cloud or a tree trunk. It's just our brains being silly and seeing patterns where there aren't any.\\n\\nEvidence from the article to support my claims:\\n\\n* \"the Face is simply a hill with a particularly symmetrical arrangement of shadows\" (Paragraph 3)\\n* \"the soil and rocks found on Mars are similar to those found on Earth\" (Paragraph 4)\\n* \"other natural features on Mars also look like faces\" (Paragraph 5)\\n\\nConclusion:\\nSo, there you have it! The Face on Mars might look like a face, but it's actually just a natural landform. It's made of regular stuff like rocks and soil, and it's just a trick of the light that makes it look like a face. I hope I've convinced you that there's no need to call in the aliens - it's just good old Mother Nature doing her thing.</td>\n","      <td>1</td>\n","      <td>You have read the article 'Unmasking the Face on Mars.'

Getting different perspectives allows you to look at the situation from various angles and get input on both the pros and cons of each option. No single person is likely to have all the information or viewpoints needed to make the optimal choice. \\n\\nTalking to multiple people helps ensure you don't miss important factors to consider. Different people will know different details relevant to your situation based on their background and experiences. Bringing more minds together brings more collective information to the table. For example, if choosing between schools to attend, asking teachers, parents and past students can surface important insights about academics, costs, extracurricular offerings and school culture that just one person may not provide.\\n\\nSeeking multiple opinions also helps account for any biases a single adviser may have. We all have unconscious biases that can slant our advice in a certain direction without us meaning to. But getting feedback from more impartial parties who don't have the same inherent biases helps balance out those influences. You're less likely to be steered down a non-optimal path if more voices are part of the decision making process. \\n\\nPerhaps most importantly, considering a range of perspectives promotes more thorough critical thinking on your end. Discussing pros and cons with different people requires actively thinking through tradeoffs and hypothetical outcomes. This strengthens your own analysis and helps ensure your final choice factors in multiple important criteria rather than just a single top priority or impression. The stakes are higher and your decision is more well-informed when you use the collective insights of several trusted advisers rather than just one.\\n\\nIn conclusion, seeking multiple opinions provides more complete information, reduces potential personal biases, and cultivates stronger critical thinking - all of which can lead to a “better” choice. Making important decisions alone deprives you of these benefits, so consulting with friends, family members, and experts is wise whenever the option is available. The views of one person, no matter how close, are rarely sufficient for complex choices that impact our lives in major ways.</td>\n","      <td>1</td>\n","      <td>NaN</td>\n","      <td>darragh_claude_v6</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>5532</th>\n","      <td>Dear Principal Smith,\\n\\nI am writing to you regarding the proposal to require all students to perform community service. While helping our community is certainly admirable, I do not think mandatory service is the best approach. \\n\\nForcing students to volunteer takes away the spirit of service. Community organizations rely on kindhearted volunteers who genuinely want to help others. Students who are required to volunteer may perceive it as a burden rather than an opportunity. They may half-heartedly go through the motions without truly committing to their role, which would not provide as meaningful an experience for those being helped. \\n\\nInstead of making service mandatory, I think inspiring students' internal motivation would be more effective. Students could be educated on the important role that volunteers play and the impact they can make. Highlighting success stories and testimonials from grateful community members may encourage some to volunteer of their own accord. For those still unsure, optional service opportunities could be provided to allow interested students to try it out and see the rewards of volunteering firsthand. \\n\\nWhile the intention of mandating service is to encourage selflessness, it may backfire by fostering resentment. A better approach is to lead by example and cultivate students' empathy and care for others and urge them to serve out of their own sense of compassion. Not all students may feel ready, but many would rise to the occasion if given the opportunity to volunteer freely according to their own interests and schedule. Overall, inspiring voluntary service through positivity, not requirements, will likely achieve the most meaningful results for both students and the community in the long run.\\n\\nI hope you will consider these views as you make your decision. The choice to volunteer or not should be left up to the individual student. However, I'm sure that with the right encouragement, many will step up to help our community through their own motivated choice.\\n\\nSincerely,\\n[Your name]</td>\n","      <td>1</td>\n","      <td>NaN</td>\n","      <td>darragh_claude_v6</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>5533</th>\n","      <td>The implementation of a four-day school week with extended hours for primary and secondary schools in the United States has been a topic of discussion for several years. While some argue that this would be beneficial for students and teachers, others believe it would have negative impacts on the economy and academics. In this essay, I will examine the viability of this proposal and analyze arguments for and against, considering economic and academic impacts, and suggest a conclusion that balances these concerns.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne of the main arguments in favor of a four-day school week is that it would reduce stress levels for students and teachers. With fewer days in school, students would have more time to relax and engage in extracurricular activities, while teachers would have more time to plan and prepare for lessons. Additionally, extended hours would allow for more time for students to receive individualized attention from their teachers, which could lead to improved academic performance.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the other hand, opponents argue that a four-day school week would negatively impact the economy. With fewer school days, businesses would have to adjust their schedules, which could lead to decreased productivity and increased costs. Additionally, some argue that schools would need to hire more teachers to cover the extended hours, which would be expensive and could lead to higher taxes.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnother argument against a four-day school week is that it could negatively impact academics. Some argue that students would not have enough time to complete their work, which could lead to decreased academic performance. Additionally, some argue that the extended hours would not necessarily lead to improved academic performance, as students may not use the extra time effectively.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn conclusion, while the implementation of a four-day school week with extended hours for primary and secondary schools in the United States has its benefits, it also has its drawbacks. While it may reduce stress levels for students and teachers, it could negatively impact the economy and academics. To balance these concerns, schools could consider implementing a hybrid model, where students attend school for four days and work from home one day. This would allow for more flexibility and reduce the need for extended hours while still providing students with individualized attention from their teachers. Ultimately, the decision to implement a four-day school week with extended hours should be based on a careful analysis of the economic and academic impacts, as well as the needs and preferences of students, teachers, and the community.</td>\n","      <td>1</td>\n","      <td>NaN</td>\n","      <td>mistral7binstruct_v1</td>\n","    </tr>\n","  </tbody>\n","</table>\n","<p>5534 rows × 4 columns</p>\n","</div>\n","    <div class=\"colab-df-buttons\">\n","\n","  <div class=\"colab-df-container\">\n","    <button class=\"colab-df-convert\" onclick=\"convertToInteractive('df-f5d3a69d-5bc2-46e4-abe3-ca8c4897719a')\"\n","            title=\"Convert this dataframe to an interactive table.\"\n","            style=\"display:none;\">\n","\n","  <svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" height=\"24px\" viewBox=\"0 -960 960 960\">\n","    <path d=\"M120-120v-720h720v720H120Zm60-500h600v-160H180v160Zm220 220h160v-160H400v160Zm0 220h160v-160H400v160ZM180-400h160v-160H180v160Zm440 0h160v-160H620v160ZM180-180h160v-160H180v160Zm440 0h160v-160H620v160Z\"/>\n","  </svg>\n","    </button>\n","\n","  <style>\n","    .colab-df-container {\n","      display:flex;\n","      gap: 12px;\n","    }\n","\n","    .colab-df-convert {\n","      background-color: #E8F0FE;\n","      border: none;\n","      border-radius: 50%;\n","      cursor: pointer;\n","      display: none;\n","      fill: #1967D2;\n","      height: 32px;\n","      padding: 0 0 0 0;\n","      width: 32px;\n","    }\n","\n","    .colab-df-convert:hover {\n","      background-color: #E2EBFA;\n","      box-shadow: 0px 1px 2px rgba(60, 64, 67, 0.3), 0px 1px 3px 1px rgba(60, 64, 67, 0.15);\n","      fill: #174EA6;\n","    }\n","\n","    .colab-df-buttons div {\n","      margin-bottom: 4px;\n","    }\n","\n","    [theme=dark] .colab-df-convert {\n","      background-color: #3B4455;\n","      fill: #D2E3FC;\n","    }\n","\n","    [theme=dark] .colab-df-convert:hover {\n","      background-color: #434B5C;\n","      box-shadow: 0px 1px 3px 1px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.15);\n","      filter: drop-shadow(0px 1px 2px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.3));\n","      fill: #FFFFFF;\n","    }\n","  </style>\n","\n","    <script>\n","      const buttonEl =\n","        document.querySelector('#df-f5d3a69d-5bc2-46e4-abe3-ca8c4897719a button.colab-df-convert');\n","      buttonEl.style.display =\n","        google.colab.kernel.accessAllowed ?

It has a lot of meanings. It has a lot of ways to describe.\\n\\nPosition:\\n\\nMi position is negative for the word influence. It gets othes in wrong ways. It is the word that convince othes to do somthing.\\n\\nFor example:\\n\\nSomebody offer you some beer, wine, or drugs that are bad influence. If a friend say to you, hey come on lets stole that bicicle it's a bad influence. I now some people that they copy the stile life from others that is not right, so that is the bad influence. Infuence is when somebody buys things that are not health, like Mc donal's, red bulls or chips those are bad influence for you.\\n\\nConclusion:\\n\\nIn my conclusion I think that influencing others is not good because it to force many people to do several things wrong. It convince many children to go throught bad ways. However, the word influence can be exellent too. It can describes many things that can be good in your work or in your life.\",\n          \"The quote says, \\\"Unless you try to do something beyond what you already mastered, you will never grow.\\\" I disagree with this statement. Because people need extend their studies, so that they can learn new important information that can benefit new research, also they can set new ideas, so they can make new studies and discoveries. Thirdly they can grow by teaching other people how to learn the same material . You can grow be doing a lot of different activities and teaching methods\\n\\nFirst way to grow is to try to learn more by studying. This is an important factor to learn more about in full detail like Isaac newton he discovers the law of gravity because of an apple that fell on top of his head. Then he makes a lot of theories about what may cause such phenomenon, so he studied it by creating equations and and a math subject called Calculus. Their are many others for example: Shakespeare, Beethoven, Albert Einstein, Stephen Hawkins, and Leonardo DaVince. These smart men did not stop because their is always something new to discover and grow.\\n\\nSecond way to grow is discovering new information. Every single day people learn something new, which is a benefit our society weather it's good or bad because you can have new ideas or discoveries. An example is cancer. A deathly decease that can kill you and there is no cure. Scientist are doing experiment on trying to find a cure and that takes a lot of time to gather information. These scientist do not stop even though they mastered science. They want to continue helping people from suffering this bad decease they want to grow and learn more they will not stop until they find a cure, so people can live as long as possible with their families.\\n\\nThird way to grow is by teaching other people. Teaching other people can help you be a better person and letting people know your methods, so they can succeed with your help. Doing that will help yourself and other. It's another way to a good mentality, also you can grow bigger.\\n\\nIn conclusion there are different ways to grow even though you mastered it. That is why I disagree with this statement, and their is never enough or to good to learn. I will never get tired of learning new fascinating stuff about this world and the outer world.\",\n          \"Is it good idea for high school students, the can graduate in three years instead of traditional four years? Some school distract offer program that allow high school students to graduate in three years instead of four years. Most high school students who follow this plan must take courses during the summer or may not be able to take elective courses. If students end up their high school in three year, the would missed most of opportunities that could provide better knowledge and education for them. Students should not require to graduate in three years instead of four years because students could't get enough credits to graduate, and students can not improve their confidence and their knowledge.\\n\\nTo begin with, first reason, students could't receive enough credits to graduate. For example, when college student want to be successful Doctor, he or she must get enough classes during the 7 years to receive approximately credits to get their diploma, if the require to graduate in 5 years, the can't construct enough confidence to be a good Doctor for the community and society. This example shows, students should't graduate early, because the can't developed and improve their life skills, education, and knowledge. If students graduate early, the would get an anxiety and different kinda problems in their life. High school traditional four years is the natural path that can help student to be success and give them more educational opportunities.\\n\\nFurthermore, second reason, students can't improve or developed their confidence and their knowledge. For example, when the student who graduated early try to do an experiment he/she would't believe their decision and the does't have any positive confidence to get the result successful. This example shows, students should not graduate early, because the would't have any strong confidence to do something successful. Students should't required to graduate in three years instead of traditional four years of high school. If students graduate in three years of high school, the will face to anxiety problems, challenges, and work challenges.\\n\\nSome people's argue that, students should be require to graduate in three years because students will receive the most opportunity to continue their education skills. For example, when I was in Afghanistan I was about to graduate high school in 2 years, also I had the most opportunities to receive grateful education. However, students should't be require to finish their high school in three years instead of four years because students would be leftover from others and the would never confidence on the experiment and life skills. Students should't graduate in three years, the should take the elective classes to get more information about the world, regions and humans.\\n\\nIn conclusion, Students should not require to graduate in three years instead of four years because students could't get enough credits to graduate, and students can not improve their confidence and their knowledge. However, Some people's argue that, students should be require to graduate in three years because students will receive the most opportunity to continue their education skills.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"generated\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 1,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          1,\n          0\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"prompt_id\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2490,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Task: Write an essay discussing whether the greatest accomplishment in the world is being yourself in a world that is trying to change the person you are.\",\n          \"Task: Write an essay about the benefits of talking to more than one person to seek multiple opinions and make better choices.
